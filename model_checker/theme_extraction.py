Our management team will give a brief overview of the company’s performance, followed by a Q&A session. As you are aware, we do not provide specific revenue or earnings guidance. And anything said on this call which reflects our outlook for the future. or which could be construed as a forward-looking statement, must be reviewed in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. We have outlined these risks in the second slide of the quarterly fact sheet available on our website and mailed out to those who have subscribed to our mailing list. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Rajesh. Rajesh Gopinathan: Thank you, Kedar, and good morning, good afternoon and good evening to all of you. We are starting out in FY 23 on a strong note, growing 16.2% in rupee terms, 15.5% in constant currency terms and 10.2% in dollar terms. : Page 1 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) We announced our salary increases with effect from April 1st. Reflecting that and other employee costs we incurred in Q1, our operating margin for the quarter was at 23.1%, a contraction of 1.9% sequentially and 2.4% year-on-year. Net margin was at 18%. I will now invite Samir and NGS to go over different aspects of our performance during the quarter. I'll step in again later to provide some more color on the demand trends that we're seeing. Over to you, Samir. Samir Seksaria: Thank you, Rajesh. Let me first walk you through the headline number. In the first quarter of FY 23 our revenue grew 15.5% YoY on a constant currency basis. Reported revenue in INR was `527.58 billion, a year-on-year growth of 16.2%. In dollar terms, revenue was $6.78 billion, a year-on-year growth of 10.2%. Let me now go over the financials",

Reported revenue in INR was `527.58 billion, a year-on-year growth of 16.2%. In dollar terms, revenue was $6.78 billion, a year-on-year growth of 10.2%. Let me now go over the financials. As Rajesh mentioned, we announced salary increases of 5% to 8% and much higher for top performers with effect from April 1. This had a 1.5% impact on operating margins. Continued supply side challenges entailed additional expenses, such as backfilling expenses and higher subcontractor usage. This and normalizing travel expenses negated various operational efficiencies, resulting in an operating margin of 23.1%, a sequential contraction of 1.9%. Net income margin was at 18%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.5% and our accounts receivable was at 63 day sales outstanding in dollar terms, down one day compared to Q4. Net cash from operations was ₹108.1 billion, which is a cash conversion of 114%. Free cash flows were ₹100.68 billion. Invested funds as on 30th June stood at ₹527.6 billion, and the board has recommended an interim dividend of ₹8 per share. Since Milind is not here today, I will take you through the HR numbers now. On the people front, our workforce strength crossed the 600,000 mark this quarter, ending this quarter with 606,331 employees. We continue to hire talent from across the world, with a net addition of 14,136. It is a very diverse workforce with 153 nationalities represented and with the women making up 35.5% of the base. We remain committed to investing in organic talent development towards building the next generation G&T workforce.

TCS National Qualifier Test, which is gaining traction as the preferred entry level hiring platform for corporate India has made significant progress over the last one year with over 900 corporate partners at the end of Q1. Let me now cover our client metrics. Movement of clients up the revenue bands is a clear demonstration of our customer- centric strategy at work. By providing a great experience and building transformational solutions that deliver high impact outcomes, we gain goodwill and trust which translates into a steady broadening and deepening of our relationships with our clients. In Q1, we had robust client additions in every revenue bucket compared to the year ago period. We added nine more clients in the $100 million+ band, bringing the total to 59. We added 19 more clients in the $50 million+ band bringing the total to 124. We added 31 more clients to the $20 million+ band, bringing the total to 272. We added 41 : Page 4 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) more clients in the $10 million+ band bringing the total to 446. We added 64 more clients in the $5 million+ band, bringing the total to 650. We added 78 more clients in the $1 million+ band, bringing the total to 1,196.

        'We added 64 more clients in the $5 million+ band, bringing the total to 650. We added 78 more clients in the $1 million+ band, bringing the total to 1,196. Over to you, Rajesh, to give your insights on demand drivers during the quarter. Rajesh Gopinathan: Thank you, NGS. All the demand drivers we have been speaking about for the last two years continue to be very much in play. In Q1, we saw plenty of deals in each of these categories, be it cloud adoption, operating model transformation, vendor consolidations, or G&T engagements. Cloud adoption continues to be a powerful growth driver. We have plenty of deals this quarter once again and more in the pipeline. Our strong partnerships with the hyper scalers, deep expertise on their platforms, and our industry-specific solutions and domain knowledge have helped us gain share in this space. As you might have seen already, we won four Global Partner of the Year Awards and two Regional Partner Awards from Microsoft this quarter. Prior to that, we won two Partner of the Year Awards from Google Cloud. The full list is published in our earnings press release available on our website. Let me now spend a little bit of time on the operations transformation opportunity, which is a big contributor to our revenue growth, order book and pipeline. We see three distinct trends here. • There are more and more clients looking to leverage next-generation technologies to create leaner, agile, resilient and efficient operation with an intent to plow back the savings into the business transformation initiatives. We have been big beneficiaries of this trend. A game changer has been TCS Cognix™, our AI-driven human machine collaboration suite, which we launched in 2020. It features a large number of pre-built configurable and reusable digital solutions, covering a wide range of industries and business function. Today, the suite consists of 530 value builders, covering an extensive set of business and technology use cases',
        "We have been big beneficiaries of this trend. A game changer has been TCS Cognix™, our AI-driven human machine collaboration suite, which we launched in 2020. It features a large number of pre-built configurable and reusable digital solutions, covering a wide range of industries and business function. Today, the suite consists of 530 value builders, covering an extensive set of business and technology use cases. Over 267 customers have leveraged Cognix™ across business and operations to drive business outcomes. In Q1, we had six new wins featuring Cognix™. • The second trend is the growing incidence of multi services integrated deals. By bringing multiple elements of the operation stack, such as business processes, applications, databases, operating systems and underlying infrastructure, all within the scope of a single service provider, clients are not : Page 5 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) only able to drive greater accountability, but also take up transformation programs that are more holistic in nature. This trend plays to our strengths in terms of our structure, as well as our ability to bring together different capabilities from across TCS to create a seamless service delivery team. We have six new multi service integrated deals in Q1 versus two to three deals per quarter in FY'22. • An adjunct to these two trends is that clients are looking to reduce complexity by bringing down the number of service providers they work with to a few select partners who possess the right innovation capabilities and can scale. We won several large deals in Q1 which were vendor consolidation exercises. Let me switch gears and talk about the airline industry which is no stranger to consolidation. There is an industry level transformation taking place there, designed to make airlines much more competitive and customer-centric, and TCS is playing a big role in helping industry players transform",
        'We won several large deals in Q1 which were vendor consolidation exercises. Let me switch gears and talk about the airline industry which is no stranger to consolidation. There is an industry level transformation taking place there, designed to make airlines much more competitive and customer-centric, and TCS is playing a big role in helping industry players transform. The airline industry is heavily dependent on ticketing platforms whose legacy proprietary models restrict airlines’ ability to offer new products and services in a direct- to-consumer or B2C model. This is preventing them from establishing competitive differentiation and is resulting in an opportunity loss. To address this problem, the International Air Transportation Association or IATA, has come up with a new open standard called New Distribution Capabilities, or NDC, which airlines can use to dynamically create personalized offers for customers. This enables a customer-specific bundling of preferences, such as number of check-in bags, seat choices, in-flight amenities, refreshments, or even in-flight shopping, priced uniquely for sale through their own channels or through third-party aggregators and travel agents. TCS is currently engaged with three airlines in implementing NDC, and in discussion with a couple more. For a leading UK-based carrier, which is an early adopter of this initiative, TCS did the end-to-end business process redesign and solution development for NDC adoption. Since deployment, the airlines NDC channel daily bookings have grown 500%, contributing to more than 20% of the overall indirect bookings and helping the airline become a digital retailer and personalize the customers experience and drive new revenues',

Moving on to the next theme of how TCS is helping clients adopt innovative technology- enabled business models that drive new revenue streams, let me share two examples: : Page 6 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) • TCS has partnered with a senior care of a leading US-based provider of long- term care insurance in launching a new line of business and assisted living marketplace. The platform will allow seekers of long-term care to find the closest assisted living care providers and also offer subscription-based consultation. Using design thinking approach, TCS helped define the product roadmap and carved a playbook for product positioning and targeting customer base in competitive market. The new marketplace will be formally launched this month and is targeting million customers over the next three years. In addition to driving new subscription-based revenues, the platform will allow the parent company to embed its insurance product in every transaction in the marketplace. • Similarly, a large Fortune 500 electric gas utility has launched a new business model to generate a new revenue stream based on home energy services, that is providing warranty repair, refurbishment and replacement services of home appliances, such as air conditioners, washing machines and refrigerators. It partnered with TCS to build the platform needed to enable the service delivery that is central to this new business',

It partnered with TCS to build the platform needed to enable the service delivery that is central to this new business. We built a new cloud-based field service automation solution based on a third- party platform to provide advanced capabilities in intelligent scheduling, dispatching and mobile workforce management to transform field operations. The new solution has helped significantly improve the predictability of services, enhancing customer experience. It is also highly scalable. The utility now plans to expand to more states in the next six months, and achieve half a billion dollars in revenue over the next 24-months. In earlier calls, I have given many examples of enterprises partnering with us to achieve their sustainability goals. There are a couple of stories where sustainability is directly linked to revenue growth. • TCS is the strategic partner for a global alliance, that is focused on decarbonizing the food value chain by helping to transform farming practices globally, promote regenerative farming and generate reliable farm carbon credits and certified climate smart crops. We have helped them conceptualize the business model and build the enabling digital platform for farmer enablement and adoption. It provides a simple and quick way to onboard farmers and other stakeholders, validate carbon smart : Page 7 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) practices through analytics, enables a carbon credit declaration by farmers and provides personalized recommendations of the practices',

The platform drives revenue for the alliance through carbon credit trading, improves farmer incomes and reduces scope pre-emissions and helps the private sector decarbonize. • Similarly, in Massachusetts, we partnered with a leading utility to build a platform that would help them roll out the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target or SMART incentive system to accelerate solar power adoption in the state. Consumers who install solar panels and storage on the property and to the utilities grid, qualify to receive a monthly incentive payment directly from the state government. The TCS-built solution includes onboarding of new generators, a customer application that helps keep track of the units generated, a pricing engine and a billing system. Using this, the utility was able to achieve regulatory targets on renewable capacity onboarding on the grid. It was able to enroll more than 10,000 residential customers in the last 12 months and is now expanding the program to other states. M&A remains the preferred growth strategy for many enterprises and over the last few years, we have built up a significant business catering to our clients need to integrate new entities that they have acquired or diverse businesses that are no longer strategic. This quarter too, we have few wins in that space. • A global leader in health, nutrition and biosciences is building its nutrition portfolio through acquisitions',
        'M&A remains the preferred growth strategy for many enterprises and over the last few years, we have built up a significant business catering to our clients need to integrate new entities that they have acquired or diverse businesses that are no longer strategic. This quarter too, we have few wins in that space. • A global leader in health, nutrition and biosciences is building its nutrition portfolio through acquisitions. In 2020, after executing its largest and most complex acquisition in two decades, it engaged TCS to help integrate the new entity. Our team helped envision changes to the enterprise model to allow for a seamless integration. The first phase of integration was completed in Q1 and helped bring onboard the new entity, provide common ways of working and deliver synergies. We commonly think of G&T as front-end customer-facing work. But we have plenty of examples of operations transformation that reimagine processes at the backend using digital technologies like AI, resulting in much faster turnaround times, much higher throughput, and therefore, more revenue. Let me give you a couple of examples of these: : Page 8 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) • For a leading global HR services firm, TCS partnered to transform their core recruitment process leveraging next-generation technologies. Their existing processes entailed recruiters spending 60% to 70% of their effort on profile sourcing and screening, of which 50% was devoted to candidate outreach. Over half the outreach efforts was wasted due to lack of response or declines. TCS redesigned the end-to-end recruitment process, taking a Machine First™ approach. We built bots to automate the background check initiations across clients and deployed a third-party AI-powered candidate outreach platform to significantly bring down recruiter effort and completely streamline the candidate screening process',

We built bots to automate the background check initiations across clients and deployed a third-party AI-powered candidate outreach platform to significantly bring down recruiter effort and completely streamline the candidate screening process. This resulted in a 300% increase in number of shortlist candidates, a 15-20% reduction in turnaround time, and most importantly, a 42% increase in hiring throughput, which is directly linked to revenue growth for the company. • Similarly, a large US insurer has engaged TCS to transform its personal lines of business. The vision is to simplify business processes, modernize the technology stack, enable faster launch of new products and product enhancements for greater competitiveness, enhanced customer experience and profitable growth. TCS helped reimagine and implement significant improvements in pricing, risk assessment, acquisition and servicing of customers using a third-party platform. On completion, the new solution will enable ensure issuance of a new policy in eight minutes versus the current 24-hours. It will significantly improve the quality, granularity and timeliness of data and analytics to support better targeting and personalization. The solutions or features are expected to help improve business agility, enhance customer experience and drive growth. Coming to the Q1 order book, as you know, we had an all-time high order book TCV last quarter. On the back of that, we again had a strong set of deal wins in Q1 amounting to a TCV of $8.2 billion. The deal mix is very heterogeneous, with the largest two deals being just over $400 million in size. By vertical, BFSI had a TCV of $2.6 billion, while retail order book stood at $1.2 billion. The TCV of deals signed in North America stood at $4.5 billion',

The TCV of deals signed in North America stood at $4.5 billion. Looking at the strong order book and our pipeline, this is good visibility for the next few months. We have not seen any budget cuts or deferments so far. In conversations with clients, we see continuing investments in technology. Some clients, particularly in Europe have expressed concerns about the macroeconomic fallout of the ongoing : Page 9 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) conflict there. But the predominant sense is that technology spending will be resilient. That said, given the macro level uncertainties, we remain very watchful. With that, we'll open the line for questions. Over to you, Kedar. Moderator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from the line of Ankur Rudra from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Ankur Rudra: A few questions from me today. First, Rajesh, could you maybe elaborate on the tone of conversations you had with clients on perhaps new growth and transformation contracts. How has that evolved this quarter? And in addition to that, how do you think the pipeline formation has been? And finally, how should we interpret the fact that deal signing to the growth on a year-over-year basis seems to be sort of flattening out and the book-to-bill ratio seem to be lower than the last couple of years? Rajesh Gopinathan: Hi Ankur. As you can imagine, we have been staying very close to our customers given the overall news flow that we see all around us",

And finally, how should we interpret the fact that deal signing to the growth on a year-over-year basis seems to be sort of flattening out and the book-to-bill ratio seem to be lower than the last couple of years? Rajesh Gopinathan: Hi Ankur. As you can imagine, we have been staying very close to our customers given the overall news flow that we see all around us. We have been at all levels personally reaching out, meeting with as many customers as we can. The general sense that we're getting is that at the operating level, the demand continues to be very strong and unabated. There is high visibility of project funding; there is appetite for continuing investments and in fact, for acceleration. So, the demand environment on an immediate basis continues to be very strong. Some conversations at senior executive levels – CEO, COO, level, etc., are more about what they see overall about the whole macro environment that you spoke about. But that elevated conversation does not seem to be reflecting in the actual budgets and the spend. We have not seen any project cancellations, pull backs, nothing of that sort. And this is across both transformation projects as well as on the optimization projects. Overall, we are, as you can imagine, staying very vigilant, maximizing contact with customers and taking it on a case-to-case basis, and reacting to what we have on hand and maintaining that stance. Ankur Rudra: Second part, Rajesh, should investors read anything into the fact that the book-to-bill ratios have dropped a bit this year versus the last years at this time? Rajesh Gopinathan: TCV is a forward-looking number. It is what it is. I gave you the commentary on what we're seeing on the field. The actual closures, that number is there. When we look at our pipeline and overall trend, I don't think there's anything that is alarming for us. A 1",

Rajesh Gopinathan: Ankur, we have been continuously investing in improving our strength on both sides of the market opportunity. That is what we call the twin-engine strategy of cost and optimization, and growth and transformation. The transformation part of the agenda is equally applicable on either side of that economic scenario. So, from a positioning perspective, we are quite happy with where we are both in terms of capabilities as well as our positioning in the market and our client engagement. That's an area that we have been continuously investing in. From an operating perspective, we have built up the capacity, we are well positioned to be able to move rapidly in either direction, if things change in any way. So, I'm quite confident that our agility is going to be able to be our biggest strength, and also our reputation and our client relationships will come through significantly if there is some uncertainty or any volatility.

Ankur Rudra: Last question on margins if I can. Were there more headwinds in 1Q than previously thought, Samir, and do you think the range of outcomes now for the year looks maybe softer than what you thought a quarter ago? Rajesh Gopinathan: Could you repeat that, Ankur? You're saying as far as margin goes… Ankur Rudra: As far as margin goes, do you think you saw more headwinds in June quarter versus what you thought in the beginning of the quarter in terms of the percentage and how do you think about the rest of the year now? Rajesh Gopinathan: Nothing different from what we saw in the beginning of the quarter. There are two things that are playing out there. One is the wage increase, which is a fairly well understood one. The other is the continuing demand environment and the attrition environment that is leading to the increased operating costs on the employee side. The attrition is not totally unanticipated, but it is continuing and we think that probably it will take another few more months before it will start to come down. So, till then the margin pressures will continue but we hope to sequentially improve from where we are, given that we have taken a hit on that completely. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Sandip Agarwal from Edelweiss. Please go ahead",

Please go ahead. : Page 11 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) Sandip Agarwal: Rajesh, I have only one question that, when you're talking to the senior executives in your client side, do you see that there is increased recognition in last few quarters that technology is much more core to their business for their growth and profitability than it being something which could be contracted or expanded based on the overall environment or based on the company's performance? The thing I'm trying to understand here is if you see some of the US retailers, they have sounded caution in terms of revenue growth and PAT growth. But at the same time, I think that they have to spend in technology to be relevant in the omnichannel mode. And also secondly, I think, outsourcing is always the most efficient or cost-efficient way of managing things in tough times. So, what is your sense on that, is it really like two decades back or one decade back when you could contract or expand based on your profit and loss account or it is more core to business and to achieve the top line number you need to spend, so, it is not at all discretionary in nature, what is your sense when you speak to your top clients? Rajesh Gopinathan: Sandip, industry-after-industry, the primacy of the technology spend continues to increase and that's reflected in our conversations with clients at senior levels also. So, there is much greater understanding, much greater appreciation of what their technology agenda is",
        "So, there is much greater understanding, much greater appreciation of what their technology agenda is. More importantly, even the most senior person is fully clued in on what the technology strategy or the technology-enabled strategy for the company is respectively. So, that awareness and that centrality of that strategy to their overall plans is very high. Having said that, definitely, if there is an economy wide slowdown, it is likely to have some ripple effect across all lines of spend, but resiliency of technology in the overall mix is unlikely to get diluted from where it has been in the last two years. Sandip Agarwal: On this subcon expense, we are still seeing a significant jump on a quarter-on-quarter basis and what I understand is that it may be partly due to attrition numbers going up. So, is it purely because of attrition going up or it is also related to some restrictions, which were there still in travel side and not been able to spend resources on time or what it is or it is sudden demand, sudden startup project, what is causing that continuous shift in subcon? Rajesh Gopinathan: Sandip, it's a combination of all of it. Definitely, attrition has a role and supply constraints in some of the local markets have a role. Also the fact that it is a variable cost and therefore it has strategic value to us in an uncertain environment. So, all aspects of it play out. We are keeping a close watch on it and we will be reacting to it depending on how the demand/supply situation plays out. : Page 12 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) Moderator: The next question is from the line of Kumar Rakesh from BNP Paribas.

Please go ahead. Kumar Rakesh: My first question was again on the margin side. So, on the subcon side, hypothetically speaking, suppose we enter into a weak demand scenario, and that is one of the levers which we potentially have to improve our cost structure. In such a scenario, how much of this subcon benefit we can potentially drive? What I'm trying to understand is how much of our cost impact is coming from subcon currently given the supply constraint which we are facing? Samir Seksaria: So, our subcontractor expenses currently are at 9.7% of our revenues, and have moved up from about 7% levels to where we are currently. And as Rajesh pointed out, we have proactively and strategically invested in creating a bench. Our current priorities are to stay focused on capturing the demand. And we have known how to balance on the subcontractor side. And as the need arises, we'll be able to realign it or balance it. Kumar Rakesh: So, what I understand is that we can stabilize it at 7% if the need arises, right? Samir Seksaria: Yes. Kumar Rakesh: My second question was around the fresher hiring target we had set about 40,000. How we are progressing on that and has that changed that target? Rajesh Gopinathan: No, we are on track for that and we're progressing well on it. This quarter reflecting what we already had in the system, we've been a bit lighter on the one which typically has been our long term trend, Q1 is a lighter quarter for trainee absorption whereas Q2 and Q3 are the primary quarters. Last year, we had gone very aggressive and hired through the year to build up more than 100,000 trainee bench. This year is more than normal. We're progressing well on that 40,000 mark. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Gaurav Rateria from Morgan Stanley",

Moderator: The next question is from the line of Gaurav Rateria from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Gaurav Rateria: So, first question is with respect to the UK market. If you look at the YoY growth, it has been actually slowing down and it's a clear divergence compared to the North America market, which is continuing to remain very, very strong. So, what's really going on there, are the trends or the discussions actually fructifying in the form of a little bit of a slowdown in the velocity of the deal closures, or the ramp ups, any trend that you can highlight will be helpful. N G Subramaniam: NGS here. Both in the UK and North American market, we don't see any anomalies or abnormalities in terms of customer behavior or the deal closure trends. All of this : Page 13 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) remains normal and in line with typically what we experience. Specifically in the UK, there have been some concerns about the increased cost of living that people experience, etc., But then, it's all in the macro level discussions that we have. But overall, as Rajesh pointed out, customers across our verticals, Manufacturing or Retail or Financial services, have not expressed anything, which is something that that will cause a concern for us at this moment. Gaurav Rateria: Second question is on the margin. So, getting back to 25% looks like an immediate priority, but should one thing that from a full year perspective, the margins could remain a tad lower than 25% as it will take some bit of progression to come to 25% over the coming quarters? Samir Seksaria: That has always been the case. Our Q1 margins are subdued when we gave out the full cycle of increment",

Samir Seksaria: That has always been the case. Our Q1 margins are subdued when we gave out the full cycle of increment. And we do look forward to clawing it back during the period. And our target would be to reach and cross 25% as far as possible. Gaurav Rateria: Lastly, any change in your expectations with respect to price improvements that you were expecting, realization improvement that you were expecting as part of your client conversations a couple of months back that you had highlighted? Rajesh Gopinathan: No, it continues to be positive. Rather than large scale contract level changes, we're seeing more pointed ones on existing contracts and the newer contracts getting some uplift. So, we're seeing smaller increases in existing ones and newer contracts coming in at better terms. Also with existing renewals, certain terms like COLA are much better being able to push through. But the aggregate impact of it is still not positive. So, our overall realization numbers reflect the excess capacity that we have, and are still negative on a sequential basis. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Ravi Menon from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Ravi Menon: Rajesh, are there any soft spots that you see in any vertical you're seeing in the pipeline shift towards more efficiency or programs? Rajesh Gopinathan: No, Ravi, we're not seeing much from a vertical perspective. It seems to be fairly balanced across. Nothing at this stage that you can call out at a vertical level. Ravi Menon: We had heard your comments in the press conference, you were talking about how the US will likely be the main driver of growth during the near term",

Rajesh Gopinathan: No, Ravi, we're not seeing much from a vertical perspective. It seems to be fairly balanced across. Nothing at this stage that you can call out at a vertical level. Ravi Menon: We had heard your comments in the press conference, you were talking about how the US will likely be the main driver of growth during the near term. But I thought in Europe, our market share is still fairly small. So, we should have a lot of these gen-two outsourcing contracts come out. So, shouldn't that also be a driver at least medium term once uncertainty settles a bit? : Page 14 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) Rajesh Gopinathan: The context of the comment is more in terms of what we're hearing from customers. You're right that traditionally, when Europe has done badly, we've still done much better, reflecting that lower market share and our continuous consolidation in that market. What I was mentioning was that when we look at the kind of commentary that we're hearing from customers, in US, the expectation is that they don't know if there is going to be a recession, when is it going to be, and even if it comes it will be a shallow one. Whereas the expectation in Europe is that it is more of a question of time, and it might be much deeper than what the US customers feel. So, that difference in perception is what we were commenting about, that US is the one where the confidence levels are high, and the demand environment is likely to stay very robust. How it plays out for us, that will depend on how well we are able to capitalize on both sides of that equation. Ravi Menon: One follow up, I think we've talked about the bench quite a bit. We've seen strong hiring well ahead of revenue growth for quite some time now",
        "So, that difference in perception is what we were commenting about, that US is the one where the confidence levels are high, and the demand environment is likely to stay very robust. How it plays out for us, that will depend on how well we are able to capitalize on both sides of that equation. Ravi Menon: One follow up, I think we've talked about the bench quite a bit. We've seen strong hiring well ahead of revenue growth for quite some time now. But we've also seen sub contracting keep going up. While you've been building up capacity and bench, so why is this not really showing up in lower subcontracting, when should we start seeing revenue growth and headcount growth start converging? Rajesh Gopinathan: See, subcontractors are also based on supply disruptions at a local market level. So, that definitely has a role to play. As travel opens up, as more normal talent movement opens up, our opportunity to optimize that will also improve. The aggregate bench versus the one will also play up depending on what our long term view or medium term view on demand is. So, there are both drivers at play. One is immediate capture of demand and the other is the supply disruption in local markets. Ravi Menon: When you said that you should see this normalize, should this also be linked to attrition, when we see attrition start coming off, should we think about you know, the utilization moving up? Rajesh Gopinathan: You're saying that as attrition comes down, will utilization move up? Yes, that's a reasonable assumption. That's our typical operating model also. When in a high demand scenario, we first address demand and attrition is also linked into that. So, we'll see. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah from Equirus Securities. Please go ahead. : Page 15 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) Sandeep Shah: Most of the questions have been answered",

Please go ahead. : Page 15 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) Sandeep Shah: Most of the questions have been answered. Just on Europe, you have discussed about UK. Can you also discuss about continental Europe because in the last four to five quarters, the growth in continental Europe on a sequential basis is a bit lower and softish versus company average. So, one can believe with the macro concerns or this is more specific to TCS as a whole? Rajesh Gopinathan: That we'll have to look across, but we are not seeing any significant change to the demand environment in Europe across the board. 12% is still a decent growth number. As I said, the commentary that we're hearing from clients is a bit more mixed in Europe compared to North America, but at an immediate demand basis, we're not seeing anything that is significant. Sandeep Shah: And just a second question that with increasing macro concerns, some of your global peers are saying clients have also started discussion on outsourcing led deals, which you also highlighted, Rajesh, in your comments where the multi-tower outsourcing deals are increasing in first quarter versus the last four quarters. So, is it fair to say that outsourcing led deals can increase and large caps including you could be a fair beneficiary of this going forward? Rajesh Gopinathan: Our twin engine strategy is essentially predicated on that we have relevance in both scenarios, both consolidation scenario as well as growth scenario",
        "So, is it fair to say that outsourcing led deals can increase and large caps including you could be a fair beneficiary of this going forward? Rajesh Gopinathan: Our twin engine strategy is essentially predicated on that we have relevance in both scenarios, both consolidation scenario as well as growth scenario. So, we do believe that our continuous investment in a broad-based set of services and holistic structure positions us very well to be a single source strategic provider to the client, who can actually use that opportunity to drive the transformation and set themselves up for the growth phase also. And that value is what is driving some of those deals that we have described in this quarter. Sandeep Shah: Last year because of attrition and supply side issue, our margin pull off from the first quarter seasonal decline was lower in the second to fourth quarter. One can say we are largely behind and from 2Q to 4Q of FY'23 our normal seasonality may start where margin pull off on the upward side could be higher versus what we have seen in FY'22. Samir Seksaria: Yes, that is reasonable to expect. We should see an upward trajectory, that's our target. Last year, we saw the full impact of supply side playing out and that's what played out on the margins as well. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Debashish Mazumdar from B&K Securities. Please go ahead. D Mazumdar: Just one small question. I need to understand as far as the margin trajectory is concerned, in a normal year, we see the entry margins are lower and exit margins are normally higher, which was not the case last year; last year, we started with 25.5%, we : Page 16 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) ended with 25%. So, this year, we are starting with 23.1%. So, how confident we are that this 23",

So, this year, we are starting with 23.1%. So, how confident we are that this 23.1% trajectory when you move out from hereon and it is kind of bottomed- out? Samir Seksaria: I just responded the same thing to the previous question as well. Our target is we expect that it would be on an increasing trajectory. And that has been the usual trend except for last year. Our target is that it should improve and we should get closer to what we exited in Q4. D Mazumdar: If we see the competition statements around attrition, the quarterly annualized attrition for other competition has started coming down from Q4 onwards, whereas for us the commentary that is stabling currently. So, just wanted to get some sense and from the salary hikes it seems to be the salary hikes are almost similar to the salary hike that we have given last year, whereas some of our competitions were extremely aggressive in giving salary hikes. So, just wanted to get some sense that in terms of controlling attrition… I'm not asking about the overall number, because it is much lower than peers, but in terms of trajectory of controlling attrition, like we are a little behind the curve as compared to others. Rajesh Gopinathan: Our employee rewards program is much more holistic than period-to-period one. I believe that our employee retention numbers also reflect this holistic employee engagement and total rewards program. So, we are quite confident about where we are. You will recall that even at the height of the pandemic, we were the ones who first said that we will not be laying off anybody",
        "Rajesh Gopinathan: Our employee rewards program is much more holistic than period-to-period one. I believe that our employee retention numbers also reflect this holistic employee engagement and total rewards program. So, we are quite confident about where we are. You will recall that even at the height of the pandemic, we were the ones who first said that we will not be laying off anybody. We honored all offers, we were the first to announce the salary hikes in October of 2020. So, our program is not entirely based on what the short-term impacts are and we're quite confident and comfortable with what we're executing. We believe that these numbers will reflect that. So, as I said, our expectation is that attrition will start tapering off in the next few months being three months, four months, whatever is the time. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Dipesh Mehta from Emkay Global. Please go ahead. Dipesh Mehta: A couple of questions. Starting with regional market, if I look at our regional market performance remain muted for some time and even though BFSI also remains softer, so if you can provide some sense about how we should look at regional market? Second question is about the fresher hiring. We are indicating about 40,000 for FY 23. But considering that we plan one year advance, how many offers are we planning for : Page 17 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) FY 24? And last question is about deal pipeline. Any softness or any uptick we're seeing in deal pipeline build up, if you can comment on that? N G Subramaniam: Regional markets, by definition, is volatile. We group some of our emerging businesses and emerging market businesses into that bucket",
        "Any softness or any uptick we're seeing in deal pipeline build up, if you can comment on that? N G Subramaniam: Regional markets, by definition, is volatile. We group some of our emerging businesses and emerging market businesses into that bucket. But overall, if you look at it, how the Asia Pacific market or functions of the Middle East, Africa market functions, these markets do not provide big opportunities for an annuity-based revenue, there are typically project-based revenues. So, there is always a volatility that is there. The second question was with respect to the fresher hiring of 40,000. As Rajesh mentioned, we are – Dipesh Mehta: No, question was for '24. N G Subramaniam: I think, on average, we always started with 40,000 given our size and shape of our business. But then you really look at the last year as well when we said the 40,000, but then when we went on to hire up to 100,000, our hiring engine was able to do that. So, we have that ability and agility to hire talent and fortunately, we are able to attract the right talent given our brand, given the opportunities that we offer to our employees. Dipesh Mehta: Last question was about deal pipeline built up. Any changes we are seeing there? N G Subramaniam: We are not seeing any major deviation or abnormalities in that. With a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2, it is looking good and the combination of the pipeline that we are pursuing today across the markets is quite similar to what we have experienced now in the previous years and the type of opportunities are also in line with the demand that we see for the type of technologies and a good combination of both cost optimization as well as growth and transformation. It also has several large, medium as well as smaller deals. Good broad-based pipeline that we have, and we are happy with what we have been able to put in the pipeline and then pursuing those opportunities. Dipesh Mehta: Last question is about onsite salary",

Good broad-based pipeline that we have, and we are happy with what we have been able to put in the pipeline and then pursuing those opportunities. Dipesh Mehta: Last question is about onsite salary. Can you quantify what kind of hike we give for onsite employees this quarter? N G Subramaniam: Average is between 4% and 5% for the onsite salary hikes we have given. But give allowance to the fact that for top performers, the potential earnout has been higher based on their performance. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Manik Taneja from JM Financial. Please go ahead. Manik Taneja: I had a couple of questions. Number one is that you mentioned that some of your senior client executive conversations are suggesting some concerns on the macro economic : Page 18 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) environment. Is that also translating in terms of any potential impact on pricing discussions? Rajesh Gopinathan: As I said earlier, the discussions on macro are not getting reflected in any of the actual project contract or deal pipeline currently. And I just gave you that color in terms of the nature of the competition and how that is different market-to-market. We are not seeing any reflection of that at the actual operating and deal levels. Manik Taneja: I wanted to understand if you would be looking to revisit the onboarding timelines for the 40,000-odd freshers offers that we made for FY'23 if the situation deteriorates. Rajesh Gopinathan: We do not do that. We honor all offers that we make. We do not defer joining or do any form of such management. That's not part of our philosophy. Any offer that we make, we honor it based on whatever is the timeline committed on it. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Apurva Prasad from HDFC Securities. Please go ahead.

Apurva Prasad: Rajesh, just a couple of quick ones. Most of the others have been covered. So, first one is on pricing. Are you seeing any incremental challenges in getting price increase even though that being selective say versus the previous quarter? And the second question is on Retail and CPG. Are there some early signs of some softness there, and I'm referencing to the book-to-bill has been significantly higher than the past three years, this looks excellent down a lot more. Rajesh Gopinathan: No, on pricing, actually, the conversations are picking up momentum rather than losing momentum. So, absolutely no reflection there. On retail, those TCV numbers are normal nature of TCV rather than anything else. We are seeing very strong transformation agendas across many retailers, especially grocery and essential retailers, where significant transformation programs are getting executed and we see continuing demand. So, overall the pipeline is quite strong and the demand environment also in retail is very strong. Moderator: Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. I now hand the conference over to the management for the closing comments. Rajesh Gopinathan: Thank you. It has been a good start to the year with 15.5% growth in constant currency, and with all our industry verticals showing good growth. Our order book and pipeline is also very strong, giving us good visibility for the next few months. Our margin dipped this quarter due to salary increase and supply side related costs. But we stay confident in our ability to bring it back to a preferred range over time",

Our attrition continues to be elevated at 19.7% in IT services on an LTM basis. This will probably peak next quarter and will start tapering out. With that we wrap up our call.

With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Rajesh. Rajesh Gopinathan: Thank you, Kedar, and good morning, good afternoon and good evening to all of you. We are starting out in FY 23 on a strong note, growing 16.2% in rupee terms, 15.5% in constant currency terms and 10.2% in dollar terms. : Page 1 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) We announced our salary increases with effect from April 1st. Reflecting that and other employee costs we incurred in Q1, our operating margin for the quarter was at 23.1%, a contraction of 1.9% sequentially and 2.4% year-on-year. Net margin was at 18%. I will now invite Samir and NGS to go over different aspects of our performance during the quarter. I'll step in again later to provide some more color on the demand trends that we're seeing. Over to you, Samir. Samir Seksaria: Thank you, Rajesh. Let me first walk you through the headline number. In the first quarter of FY 23 our revenue grew 15.5% YoY on a constant currency basis. Reported revenue in INR was `527.58 billion, a year-on-year growth of 16.2%. In dollar terms, revenue was $6.78 billion, a year-on-year growth of 10.2%. Let me now go over the financials",

As Rajesh mentioned, we announced salary increases of 5% to 8% and much higher for top performers with effect from April 1. This had a 1.5% impact on operating margins. Continued supply side challenges entailed additional expenses, such as backfilling expenses and higher subcontractor usage. This and normalizing travel expenses negated various operational efficiencies, resulting in an operating margin of 23.1%, a sequential contraction of 1.9%. Net income margin was at 18%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.5% and our accounts receivable was at 63 day sales outstanding in dollar terms, down one day compared to Q4. Net cash from operations was ₹108.1 billion, which is a cash conversion of 114%. Free cash flows were ₹100.68 billion. Invested funds as on 30th June stood at ₹527.6 billion, and the board has recommended an interim dividend of ₹8 per share. Since Milind is not here today, I will take you through the HR numbers now. On the people front, our workforce strength crossed the 600,000 mark this quarter, ending this quarter with 606,331 employees. We continue to hire talent from across the world, with a net addition of 14,136. It is a very diverse workforce with 153 nationalities represented and with the women making up 35.5% of the base. We remain committed to investing in organic talent development towards building the next generation G&T workforce.

The Quartz Smart Solution for Bond Issuance is now live at one of the leading central securities depositories in India. It facilitates real-time exchange of information among multiple stakeholders, like issuers, trustees, credit rating agencies, depositories and stock exchanges on a private permissioned blockchain platform. The solution helps eliminate potential double counting of underlying assets and ensures greater transparency and governance in the bond issuance lifecycle. In Life Sciences, our award-winning advanced drug development suite had one new win, our first client for this suite in Japan. Our HOBS™ suite of solutions for communication service provider had one new win and four go lives in Q1. We also launched a new release of HOBS™ Business Assurance, which enables clients to deploy faster and more easily integrate with real-time data sources, visualize revenue leakages and take corrective actions in near real-time.

TCS National Qualifier Test, which is gaining traction as the preferred entry level hiring platform for corporate India has made significant progress over the last one year with over 900 corporate partners at the end of Q1. Let me now cover our client metrics. Movement of clients up the revenue bands is a clear demonstration of our customer- centric strategy at work. By providing a great experience and building transformational solutions that deliver high impact outcomes, we gain goodwill and trust which translates into a steady broadening and deepening of our relationships with our clients. In Q1, we had robust client additions in every revenue bucket compared to the year ago period. We added nine more clients in the $100 million+ band, bringing the total to 59. We added 19 more clients in the $50 million+ band bringing the total to 124. We added 31 more clients to the $20 million+ band, bringing the total to 272. We added 41 : Page 4 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) more clients in the $10 million+ band bringing the total to 446. We added 64 more clients in the $5 million+ band, bringing the total to 650. We added 78 more clients in the $1 million+ band, bringing the total to 1,196.

Over to you, Rajesh, to give your insights on demand drivers during the quarter. Rajesh Gopinathan: Thank you, NGS. All the demand drivers we have been speaking about for the last two years continue to be very much in play. In Q1, we saw plenty of deals in each of these categories, be it cloud adoption, operating model transformation, vendor consolidations, or G&T engagements. Cloud adoption continues to be a powerful growth driver. We have plenty of deals this quarter once again and more in the pipeline. Our strong partnerships with the hyper scalers, deep expertise on their platforms, and our industry-specific solutions and domain knowledge have helped us gain share in this space. As you might have seen already, we won four Global Partner of the Year Awards and two Regional Partner Awards from Microsoft this quarter. Prior to that, we won two Partner of the Year Awards from Google Cloud. The full list is published in our earnings press release available on our website. Let me now spend a little bit of time on the operations transformation opportunity, which is a big contributor to our revenue growth, order book and pipeline. We see three distinct trends here. • There are more and more clients looking to leverage next-generation technologies to create leaner, agile, resilient and efficient operation with an intent to plow back the savings into the business transformation initiatives. We have been big beneficiaries of this trend. A game changer has been TCS Cognix™, our AI-driven human machine collaboration suite, which we launched in 2020. It features a large number of pre-built configurable and reusable digital solutions, covering a wide range of industries and business function. Today, the suite consists of 530 value builders, covering an extensive set of business and technology use cases',

Today, the suite consists of 530 value builders, covering an extensive set of business and technology use cases. Over 267 customers have leveraged Cognix™ across business and operations to drive business outcomes. In Q1, we had six new wins featuring Cognix™. • The second trend is the growing incidence of multi services integrated deals. By bringing multiple elements of the operation stack, such as business processes, applications, databases, operating systems and underlying infrastructure, all within the scope of a single service provider, clients are not : Page 5 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) only able to drive greater accountability, but also take up transformation programs that are more holistic in nature. This trend plays to our strengths in terms of our structure, as well as our ability to bring together different capabilities from across TCS to create a seamless service delivery team. We have six new multi service integrated deals in Q1 versus two to three deals per quarter in FY'22. • An adjunct to these two trends is that clients are looking to reduce complexity by bringing down the number of service providers they work with to a few select partners who possess the right innovation capabilities and can scale. We won several large deals in Q1 which were vendor consolidation exercises. Let me switch gears and talk about the airline industry which is no stranger to consolidation. There is an industry level transformation taking place there, designed to make airlines much more competitive and customer-centric, and TCS is playing a big role in helping industry players transform",
#                 'We won several large deals in Q1 which were vendor consolidation exercises. Let me switch gears and talk about the airline industry which is no stranger to consolidation. There is an industry level transformation taking place there, designed to make airlines much more competitive and customer-centric, and TCS is playing a big role in helping industry players transform. The airline industry is heavily dependent on ticketing platforms whose legacy proprietary models restrict airlines’ ability to offer new products and services in a direct- to-consumer or B2C model. This is preventing them from establishing competitive differentiation and is resulting in an opportunity loss. To address this problem, the International Air Transportation Association or IATA, has come up with a new open standard called New Distribution Capabilities, or NDC, which airlines can use to dynamically create personalized offers for customers. This enables a customer-specific bundling of preferences, such as number of check-in bags, seat choices, in-flight amenities, refreshments, or even in-flight shopping, priced uniquely for sale through their own channels or through third-party aggregators and travel agents. TCS is currently engaged with three airlines in implementing NDC, and in discussion with a couple more. For a leading UK-based carrier, which is an early adopter of this initiative, TCS did the end-to-end business process redesign and solution development for NDC adoption. Since deployment, the airlines NDC channel daily bookings have grown 500%, contributing to more than 20% of the overall indirect bookings and helping the airline become a digital retailer and personalize the customers experience and drive new revenues',

Moving on to the next theme of how TCS is helping clients adopt innovative technology- enabled business models that drive new revenue streams, let me share two examples: : Page 6 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) • TCS has partnered with a senior care of a leading US-based provider of long- term care insurance in launching a new line of business and assisted living marketplace. The platform will allow seekers of long-term care to find the closest assisted living care providers and also offer subscription-based consultation. Using design thinking approach, TCS helped define the product roadmap and carved a playbook for product positioning and targeting customer base in competitive market. The new marketplace will be formally launched this month and is targeting million customers over the next three years. In addition to driving new subscription-based revenues, the platform will allow the parent company to embed its insurance product in every transaction in the marketplace. • Similarly, a large Fortune 500 electric gas utility has launched a new business model to generate a new revenue stream based on home energy services, that is providing warranty repair, refurbishment and replacement services of home appliances, such as air conditioners, washing machines and refrigerators. It partnered with TCS to build the platform needed to enable the service delivery that is central to this new business',

It partnered with TCS to build the platform needed to enable the service delivery that is central to this new business. We built a new cloud-based field service automation solution based on a third- party platform to provide advanced capabilities in intelligent scheduling, dispatching and mobile workforce management to transform field operations. The new solution has helped significantly improve the predictability of services, enhancing customer experience. It is also highly scalable. The utility now plans to expand to more states in the next six months, and achieve half a billion dollars in revenue over the next 24-months. In earlier calls, I have given many examples of enterprises partnering with us to achieve their sustainability goals. There are a couple of stories where sustainability is directly linked to revenue growth. • TCS is the strategic partner for a global alliance, that is focused on decarbonizing the food value chain by helping to transform farming practices globally, promote regenerative farming and generate reliable farm carbon credits and certified climate smart crops. We have helped them conceptualize the business model and build the enabling digital platform for farmer enablement and adoption. It provides a simple and quick way to onboard farmers and other stakeholders, validate carbon smart : Page 7 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) practices through analytics, enables a carbon credit declaration by farmers and provides personalized recommendations of the practices',

The platform drives revenue for the alliance through carbon credit trading, improves farmer incomes and reduces scope pre-emissions and helps the private sector decarbonize. • Similarly, in Massachusetts, we partnered with a leading utility to build a platform that would help them roll out the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target or SMART incentive system to accelerate solar power adoption in the state. Consumers who install solar panels and storage on the property and to the utilities grid, qualify to receive a monthly incentive payment directly from the state government. The TCS-built solution includes onboarding of new generators, a customer application that helps keep track of the units generated, a pricing engine and a billing system. Using this, the utility was able to achieve regulatory targets on renewable capacity onboarding on the grid. It was able to enroll more than 10,000 residential customers in the last 12 months and is now expanding the program to other states. M&A remains the preferred growth strategy for many enterprises and over the last few years, we have built up a significant business catering to our clients need to integrate new entities that they have acquired or diverse businesses that are no longer strategic. This quarter too, we have few wins in that space. • A global leader in health, nutrition and biosciences is building its nutrition portfolio through acquisitions',

This quarter too, we have few wins in that space. • A global leader in health, nutrition and biosciences is building its nutrition portfolio through acquisitions. In 2020, after executing its largest and most complex acquisition in two decades, it engaged TCS to help integrate the new entity. Our team helped envision changes to the enterprise model to allow for a seamless integration. The first phase of integration was completed in Q1 and helped bring onboard the new entity, provide common ways of working and deliver synergies. We commonly think of G&T as front-end customer-facing work. But we have plenty of examples of operations transformation that reimagine processes at the backend using digital technologies like AI, resulting in much faster turnaround times, much higher throughput, and therefore, more revenue. Let me give you a couple of examples of these: : Page 8 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) • For a leading global HR services firm, TCS partnered to transform their core recruitment process leveraging next-generation technologies. Their existing processes entailed recruiters spending 60% to 70% of their effort on profile sourcing and screening, of which 50% was devoted to candidate outreach. Over half the outreach efforts was wasted due to lack of response or declines. TCS redesigned the end-to-end recruitment process, taking a Machine First™ approach. We built bots to automate the background check initiations across clients and deployed a third-party AI-powered candidate outreach platform to significantly bring down recruiter effort and completely streamline the candidate screening process',

We built bots to automate the background check initiations across clients and deployed a third-party AI-powered candidate outreach platform to significantly bring down recruiter effort and completely streamline the candidate screening process. This resulted in a 300% increase in number of shortlist candidates, a 15-20% reduction in turnaround time, and most importantly, a 42% increase in hiring throughput, which is directly linked to revenue growth for the company. • Similarly, a large US insurer has engaged TCS to transform its personal lines of business. The vision is to simplify business processes, modernize the technology stack, enable faster launch of new products and product enhancements for greater competitiveness, enhanced customer experience and profitable growth. TCS helped reimagine and implement significant improvements in pricing, risk assessment, acquisition and servicing of customers using a third-party platform. On completion, the new solution will enable ensure issuance of a new policy in eight minutes versus the current 24-hours. It will significantly improve the quality, granularity and timeliness of data and analytics to support better targeting and personalization. The solutions or features are expected to help improve business agility, enhance customer experience and drive growth. Coming to the Q1 order book, as you know, we had an all-time high order book TCV last quarter. On the back of that, we again had a strong set of deal wins in Q1 amounting to a TCV of $8.2 billion. The deal mix is very heterogeneous, with the largest two deals being just over $400 million in size. By vertical, BFSI had a TCV of $2.6 billion, while retail order book stood at $1.2 billion. The TCV of deals signed in North America stood at $4.5 billion',

The TCV of deals signed in North America stood at $4.5 billion. Looking at the strong order book and our pipeline, this is good visibility for the next few months. We have not seen any budget cuts or deferments so far. In conversations with clients, we see continuing investments in technology. Some clients, particularly in Europe have expressed concerns about the macroeconomic fallout of the ongoing : Page 9 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) conflict there. But the predominant sense is that technology spending will be resilient. That said, given the macro level uncertainties, we remain very watchful. With that, we'll open the line for questions. Over to you, Kedar. Moderator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from the line of Ankur Rudra from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Ankur Rudra: A few questions from me today. First, Rajesh, could you maybe elaborate on the tone of conversations you had with clients on perhaps new growth and transformation contracts. How has that evolved this quarter? And in addition to that, how do you think the pipeline formation has been? And finally, how should we interpret the fact that deal signing to the growth on a year-over-year basis seems to be sort of flattening out and the book-to-bill ratio seem to be lower than the last couple of years? Rajesh Gopinathan: Hi Ankur. As you can imagine, we have been staying very close to our customers given the overall news flow that we see all around us",

Rajesh Gopinathan: Hi Ankur. As you can imagine, we have been staying very close to our customers given the overall news flow that we see all around us. We have been at all levels personally reaching out, meeting with as many customers as we can. The general sense that we're getting is that at the operating level, the demand continues to be very strong and unabated. There is high visibility of project funding; there is appetite for continuing investments and in fact, for acceleration. So, the demand environment on an immediate basis continues to be very strong. Some conversations at senior executive levels – CEO, COO, level, etc., are more about what they see overall about the whole macro environment that you spoke about. But that elevated conversation does not seem to be reflecting in the actual budgets and the spend. We have not seen any project cancellations, pull backs, nothing of that sort. And this is across both transformation projects as well as on the optimization projects. Overall, we are, as you can imagine, staying very vigilant, maximizing contact with customers and taking it on a case-to-case basis, and reacting to what we have on hand and maintaining that stance. Ankur Rudra: Second part, Rajesh, should investors read anything into the fact that the book-to-bill ratios have dropped a bit this year versus the last years at this time? Rajesh Gopinathan: TCV is a forward-looking number. It is what it is. I gave you the commentary on what we're seeing on the field. The actual closures, that number is there. When we look at our pipeline and overall trend, I don't think there's anything that is alarming for us. A 1",

Rajesh Gopinathan: Ankur, we have been continuously investing in improving our strength on both sides of the market opportunity. That is what we call the twin-engine strategy of cost and optimization, and growth and transformation. The transformation part of the agenda is equally applicable on either side of that economic scenario. So, from a positioning perspective, we are quite happy with where we are both in terms of capabilities as well as our positioning in the market and our client engagement. That's an area that we have been continuously investing in. From an operating perspective, we have built up the capacity, we are well positioned to be able to move rapidly in either direction, if things change in any way. So, I'm quite confident that our agility is going to be able to be our biggest strength, and also our reputation and our client relationships will come through significantly if there is some uncertainty or any volatility.

Ankur Rudra: Last question on margins if I can. Were there more headwinds in 1Q than previously thought, Samir, and do you think the range of outcomes now for the year looks maybe softer than what you thought a quarter ago? Rajesh Gopinathan: Could you repeat that, Ankur? You're saying as far as margin goes… Ankur Rudra: As far as margin goes, do you think you saw more headwinds in June quarter versus what you thought in the beginning of the quarter in terms of the percentage and how do you think about the rest of the year now? Rajesh Gopinathan: Nothing different from what we saw in the beginning of the quarter. There are two things that are playing out there. One is the wage increase, which is a fairly well understood one. The other is the continuing demand environment and the attrition environment that is leading to the increased operating costs on the employee side. The attrition is not totally unanticipated, but it is continuing and we think that probably it will take another few more months before it will start to come down. So, till then the margin pressures will continue but we hope to sequentially improve from where we are, given that we have taken a hit on that completely. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Sandip Agarwal from Edelweiss. Please go ahead",

Please go ahead. : Page 11 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) Sandip Agarwal: Rajesh, I have only one question that, when you're talking to the senior executives in your client side, do you see that there is increased recognition in last few quarters that technology is much more core to their business for their growth and profitability than it being something which could be contracted or expanded based on the overall environment or based on the company's performance? The thing I'm trying to understand here is if you see some of the US retailers, they have sounded caution in terms of revenue growth and PAT growth. But at the same time, I think that they have to spend in technology to be relevant in the omnichannel mode. And also secondly, I think, outsourcing is always the most efficient or cost-efficient way of managing things in tough times. So, what is your sense on that, is it really like two decades back or one decade back when you could contract or expand based on your profit and loss account or it is more core to business and to achieve the top line number you need to spend, so, it is not at all discretionary in nature, what is your sense when you speak to your top clients? Rajesh Gopinathan: Sandip, industry-after-industry, the primacy of the technology spend continues to increase and that's reflected in our conversations with clients at senior levels also. So, there is much greater understanding, much greater appreciation of what their technology agenda is",
#                 "So, there is much greater understanding, much greater appreciation of what their technology agenda is. More importantly, even the most senior person is fully clued in on what the technology strategy or the technology-enabled strategy for the company is respectively. So, that awareness and that centrality of that strategy to their overall plans is very high. Having said that, definitely, if there is an economy wide slowdown, it is likely to have some ripple effect across all lines of spend, but resiliency of technology in the overall mix is unlikely to get diluted from where it has been in the last two years. Sandip Agarwal: On this subcon expense, we are still seeing a significant jump on a quarter-on-quarter basis and what I understand is that it may be partly due to attrition numbers going up. So, is it purely because of attrition going up or it is also related to some restrictions, which were there still in travel side and not been able to spend resources on time or what it is or it is sudden demand, sudden startup project, what is causing that continuous shift in subcon? Rajesh Gopinathan: Sandip, it's a combination of all of it. Definitely, attrition has a role and supply constraints in some of the local markets have a role. Also the fact that it is a variable cost and therefore it has strategic value to us in an uncertain environment. So, all aspects of it play out. We are keeping a close watch on it and we will be reacting to it depending on how the demand/supply situation plays out. : Page 12 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) Moderator: The next question is from the line of Kumar Rakesh from BNP Paribas.

Please go ahead. Kumar Rakesh: My first question was again on the margin side. So, on the subcon side, hypothetically speaking, suppose we enter into a weak demand scenario, and that is one of the levers which we potentially have to improve our cost structure. In such a scenario, how much of this subcon benefit we can potentially drive? What I'm trying to understand is how much of our cost impact is coming from subcon currently given the supply constraint which we are facing? Samir Seksaria: So, our subcontractor expenses currently are at 9.7% of our revenues, and have moved up from about 7% levels to where we are currently. And as Rajesh pointed out, we have proactively and strategically invested in creating a bench. Our current priorities are to stay focused on capturing the demand. And we have known how to balance on the subcontractor side. And as the need arises, we'll be able to realign it or balance it. Kumar Rakesh: So, what I understand is that we can stabilize it at 7% if the need arises, right? Samir Seksaria: Yes. Kumar Rakesh: My second question was around the fresher hiring target we had set about 40,000. How we are progressing on that and has that changed that target? Rajesh Gopinathan: No, we are on track for that and we're progressing well on it. This quarter reflecting what we already had in the system, we've been a bit lighter on the one which typically has been our long term trend, Q1 is a lighter quarter for trainee absorption whereas Q2 and Q3 are the primary quarters. Last year, we had gone very aggressive and hired through the year to build up more than 100,000 trainee bench. This year is more than normal. We're progressing well on that 40,000 mark.

Gaurav Rateria: So, first question is with respect to the UK market. If you look at the YoY growth, it has been actually slowing down and it's a clear divergence compared to the North America market, which is continuing to remain very, very strong. So, what's really going on there, are the trends or the discussions actually fructifying in the form of a little bit of a slowdown in the velocity of the deal closures, or the ramp ups, any trend that you can highlight will be helpful. N G Subramaniam: NGS here. Both in the UK and North American market, we don't see any anomalies or abnormalities in terms of customer behavior or the deal closure trends. All of this : Page 13 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) remains normal and in line with typically what we experience. Specifically in the UK, there have been some concerns about the increased cost of living that people experience, etc., But then, it's all in the macro level discussions that we have. But overall, as Rajesh pointed out, customers across our verticals, Manufacturing or Retail or Financial services, have not expressed anything, which is something that that will cause a concern for us at this moment. Gaurav Rateria: Second question is on the margin. So, getting back to 25% looks like an immediate priority, but should one thing that from a full year perspective, the margins could remain a tad lower than 25% as it will take some bit of progression to come to 25% over the coming quarters? Samir Seksaria: That has always been the case. Our Q1 margins are subdued when we gave out the full cycle of increment",
#                 "Gaurav Rateria: Second question is on the margin. So, getting back to 25% looks like an immediate priority, but should one thing that from a full year perspective, the margins could remain a tad lower than 25% as it will take some bit of progression to come to 25% over the coming quarters? Samir Seksaria: That has always been the case. Our Q1 margins are subdued when we gave out the full cycle of increment. And we do look forward to clawing it back during the period. And our target would be to reach and cross 25% as far as possible. Gaurav Rateria: Lastly, any change in your expectations with respect to price improvements that you were expecting, realization improvement that you were expecting as part of your client conversations a couple of months back that you had highlighted? Rajesh Gopinathan: No, it continues to be positive. Rather than large scale contract level changes, we're seeing more pointed ones on existing contracts and the newer contracts getting some uplift. So, we're seeing smaller increases in existing ones and newer contracts coming in at better terms. Also with existing renewals, certain terms like COLA are much better being able to push through. But the aggregate impact of it is still not positive. So, our overall realization numbers reflect the excess capacity that we have, and are still negative on a sequential basis. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Ravi Menon from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Ravi Menon: Rajesh, are there any soft spots that you see in any vertical you're seeing in the pipeline shift towards more efficiency or programs? Rajesh Gopinathan: No, Ravi, we're not seeing much from a vertical perspective. It seems to be fairly balanced across. Nothing at this stage that you can call out at a vertical level. Ravi Menon: We had heard your comments in the press conference, you were talking about how the US will likely be the main driver of growth during the near term",

Ravi Menon: We had heard your comments in the press conference, you were talking about how the US will likely be the main driver of growth during the near term. But I thought in Europe, our market share is still fairly small. So, we should have a lot of these gen-two outsourcing contracts come out. So, shouldn't that also be a driver at least medium term once uncertainty settles a bit? : Page 14 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) Rajesh Gopinathan: The context of the comment is more in terms of what we're hearing from customers. You're right that traditionally, when Europe has done badly, we've still done much better, reflecting that lower market share and our continuous consolidation in that market. What I was mentioning was that when we look at the kind of commentary that we're hearing from customers, in US, the expectation is that they don't know if there is going to be a recession, when is it going to be, and even if it comes it will be a shallow one. Whereas the expectation in Europe is that it is more of a question of time, and it might be much deeper than what the US customers feel. So, that difference in perception is what we were commenting about, that US is the one where the confidence levels are high, and the demand environment is likely to stay very robust. How it plays out for us, that will depend on how well we are able to capitalize on both sides of that equation. Ravi Menon: One follow up, I think we've talked about the bench quite a bit. We've seen strong hiring well ahead of revenue growth for quite some time now",

How it plays out for us, that will depend on how well we are able to capitalize on both sides of that equation. Ravi Menon: One follow up, I think we've talked about the bench quite a bit. We've seen strong hiring well ahead of revenue growth for quite some time now. But we've also seen sub contracting keep going up. While you've been building up capacity and bench, so why is this not really showing up in lower subcontracting, when should we start seeing revenue growth and headcount growth start converging? Rajesh Gopinathan: See, subcontractors are also based on supply disruptions at a local market level. So, that definitely has a role to play. As travel opens up, as more normal talent movement opens up, our opportunity to optimize that will also improve. The aggregate bench versus the one will also play up depending on what our long term view or medium term view on demand is. So, there are both drivers at play. One is immediate capture of demand and the other is the supply disruption in local markets. Ravi Menon: When you said that you should see this normalize, should this also be linked to attrition, when we see attrition start coming off, should we think about you know, the utilization moving up? Rajesh Gopinathan: You're saying that as attrition comes down, will utilization move up? Yes, that's a reasonable assumption. That's our typical operating model also. When in a high demand scenario, we first address demand and attrition is also linked into that. So, we'll see. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah from Equirus Securities.

Just on Europe, you have discussed about UK. Can you also discuss about continental Europe because in the last four to five quarters, the growth in continental Europe on a sequential basis is a bit lower and softish versus company average. So, one can believe with the macro concerns or this is more specific to TCS as a whole? Rajesh Gopinathan: That we'll have to look across, but we are not seeing any significant change to the demand environment in Europe across the board. 12% is still a decent growth number. As I said, the commentary that we're hearing from clients is a bit more mixed in Europe compared to North America, but at an immediate demand basis, we're not seeing anything that is significant. Sandeep Shah: And just a second question that with increasing macro concerns, some of your global peers are saying clients have also started discussion on outsourcing led deals, which you also highlighted, Rajesh, in your comments where the multi-tower outsourcing deals are increasing in first quarter versus the last four quarters. So, is it fair to say that outsourcing led deals can increase and large caps including you could be a fair beneficiary of this going forward? Rajesh Gopinathan: Our twin engine strategy is essentially predicated on that we have relevance in both scenarios, both consolidation scenario as well as growth scenario",

Rajesh Gopinathan: Our twin engine strategy is essentially predicated on that we have relevance in both scenarios, both consolidation scenario as well as growth scenario. So, we do believe that our continuous investment in a broad-based set of services and holistic structure positions us very well to be a single source strategic provider to the client, who can actually use that opportunity to drive the transformation and set themselves up for the growth phase also. And that value is what is driving some of those deals that we have described in this quarter. Sandeep Shah: Last year because of attrition and supply side issue, our margin pull off from the first quarter seasonal decline was lower in the second to fourth quarter. One can say we are largely behind and from 2Q to 4Q of FY'23 our normal seasonality may start where margin pull off on the upward side could be higher versus what we have seen in FY'22. Samir Seksaria: Yes, that is reasonable to expect. We should see an upward trajectory, that's our target. Last year, we saw the full impact of supply side playing out and that's what played out on the margins as well. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Debashish Mazumdar from B&K Securities. Please go ahead. D Mazumdar: Just one small question. I need to understand as far as the margin trajectory is concerned, in a normal year, we see the entry margins are lower and exit margins are normally higher, which was not the case last year; last year, we started with 25.5%, we : Page 16 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) ended with 25%.

Samir Seksaria: I just responded the same thing to the previous question as well. Our target is we expect that it would be on an increasing trajectory. And that has been the usual trend except for last year. Our target is that it should improve and we should get closer to what we exited in Q4. D Mazumdar: If we see the competition statements around attrition, the quarterly annualized attrition for other competition has started coming down from Q4 onwards, whereas for us the commentary that is stabling currently. So, just wanted to get some sense and from the salary hikes it seems to be the salary hikes are almost similar to the salary hike that we have given last year, whereas some of our competitions were extremely aggressive in giving salary hikes. So, just wanted to get some sense that in terms of controlling attrition… I'm not asking about the overall number, because it is much lower than peers, but in terms of trajectory of controlling attrition, like we are a little behind the curve as compared to others. Rajesh Gopinathan: Our employee rewards program is much more holistic than period-to-period one. I believe that our employee retention numbers also reflect this holistic employee engagement and total rewards program. So, we are quite confident about where we are. You will recall that even at the height of the pandemic, we were the ones who first said that we will not be laying off anybody",

You will recall that even at the height of the pandemic, we were the ones who first said that we will not be laying off anybody. We honored all offers, we were the first to announce the salary hikes in October of 2020. So, our program is not entirely based on what the short-term impacts are and we're quite confident and comfortable with what we're executing. We believe that these numbers will reflect that. So, as I said, our expectation is that attrition will start tapering off in the next few months being three months, four months, whatever is the time. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Dipesh Mehta from Emkay Global. Please go ahead. Dipesh Mehta: A couple of questions. Starting with regional market, if I look at our regional market performance remain muted for some time and even though BFSI also remains softer, so if you can provide some sense about how we should look at regional market? Second question is about the fresher hiring. We are indicating about 40,000 for FY 23. But considering that we plan one year advance, how many offers are we planning for : Page 17 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) FY 24?

We group some of our emerging businesses and emerging market businesses into that bucket. But overall, if you look at it, how the Asia Pacific market or functions of the Middle East, Africa market functions, these markets do not provide big opportunities for an annuity-based revenue, there are typically project-based revenues. So, there is always a volatility that is there. The second question was with respect to the fresher hiring of 40,000. As Rajesh mentioned, we are – Dipesh Mehta: No, question was for '24. N G Subramaniam: I think, on average, we always started with 40,000 given our size and shape of our business. But then you really look at the last year as well when we said the 40,000, but then when we went on to hire up to 100,000, our hiring engine was able to do that. So, we have that ability and agility to hire talent and fortunately, we are able to attract the right talent given our brand, given the opportunities that we offer to our employees. Dipesh Mehta: Last question was about deal pipeline built up. Any changes we are seeing there? N G Subramaniam: We are not seeing any major deviation or abnormalities in that. With a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2, it is looking good and the combination of the pipeline that we are pursuing today across the markets is quite similar to what we have experienced now in the previous years and the type of opportunities are also in line with the demand that we see for the type of technologies and a good combination of both cost optimization as well as growth and transformation. It also has several large, medium as well as smaller deals. Good broad-based pipeline that we have, and we are happy with what we have been able to put in the pipeline and then pursuing those opportunities. Dipesh Mehta: Last question is about onsite salary",

Can you quantify what kind of hike we give for onsite employees this quarter? N G Subramaniam: Average is between 4% and 5% for the onsite salary hikes we have given. But give allowance to the fact that for top performers, the potential earnout has been higher based on their performance. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Manik Taneja from JM Financial. Please go ahead. Manik Taneja: I had a couple of questions. Number one is that you mentioned that some of your senior client executive conversations are suggesting some concerns on the macro economic : Page 18 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) environment. Is that also translating in terms of any potential impact on pricing discussions? Rajesh Gopinathan: As I said earlier, the discussions on macro are not getting reflected in any of the actual project contract or deal pipeline currently. And I just gave you that color in terms of the nature of the competition and how that is different market-to-market. We are not seeing any reflection of that at the actual operating and deal levels. Manik Taneja: I wanted to understand if you would be looking to revisit the onboarding timelines for the 40,000-odd freshers offers that we made for FY'23 if the situation deteriorates. Rajesh Gopinathan: We do not do that. We honor all offers that we make. We do not defer joining or do any form of such management. That's not part of our philosophy. Any offer that we make, we honor it based on whatever is the timeline committed on it. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Apurva Prasad from HDFC Securities. Please go ahead.

Apurva Prasad: Rajesh, just a couple of quick ones. Most of the others have been covered. So, first one is on pricing. Are you seeing any incremental challenges in getting price increase even though that being selective say versus the previous quarter? And the second question is on Retail and CPG. Are there some early signs of some softness there, and I'm referencing to the book-to-bill has been significantly higher than the past three years, this looks excellent down a lot more. Rajesh Gopinathan: No, on pricing, actually, the conversations are picking up momentum rather than losing momentum. So, absolutely no reflection there. On retail, those TCV numbers are normal nature of TCV rather than anything else. We are seeing very strong transformation agendas across many retailers, especially grocery and essential retailers, where significant transformation programs are getting executed and we see continuing demand. So, overall the pipeline is quite strong and the demand environment also in retail is very strong. Moderator: Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. I now hand the conference over to the management for the closing comments. Rajesh Gopinathan: Thank you. It has been a good start to the year with 15.5% growth in constant currency, and with all our industry verticals showing good growth. Our order book and pipeline is also very strong, giving us good visibility for the next few months. Our margin dipped this quarter due to salary increase and supply side related costs.

Our attrition continues to be elevated at 19.7% in IT services on an LTM basis. This will probably peak next quarter and will start tapering out. With that we wrap up our call.

And anything said on this call, which reflects our outlook for the future or which could be construed as a forward-looking statement, must be reviewed in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. We have outlined these risks in the second slide of the quarterly fact sheet available on our website and e-mailed out to those who have subscribed to our mailing lists. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rajesh. Rajesh Gopinathan: Thank you, Kedar. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening to all of you. We are very pleased with our performance in Q2. Our revenue grew 18% in rupee terms and 15.4% in constant currency terms and 8.6% in dollar terms, reflecting the continued strength of demand for our services. : Page 1 of 21 Tata Consultancy Services Q2 FY23 Earnings Conference Call October 10, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) Our operating margin for the quarter was 24%, an expansion of 0.9% sequentially and a contraction of 1.6% on a year-on-year basis. Our net profit crossed the `10,000 crore mark this quarter and our net margin was at 18.9%. I will now invite Samir, Milind and NGS to go over different aspects of our performance during the quarter. I will step in again later to provide some more color on the demand trends we are seeing. Over to you, Samir. Samir Seksaria: Thank you, Rajesh. Let me first walk youthrough the headline numbers. In the second quarter of FY 23, our revenues grew 15.4% YoY on a constant currency basis. Reported revenue in INR was `553.09 billion, a year-on-year growth of 18%. In USD terms, the sharp fall of all currencies in our basket versus the dollar in Q2, resulted in a deflated reported revenue of $6.88 billion, a YoY growth of 8.6%. While the rupee depreciated by 3.4% against the dollar sequentially, it appreciated 4.4% against GBP and 3% against euro, eroding the benefit at the operating margin level',

While the rupee depreciated by 3.4% against the dollar sequentially, it appreciated 4.4% against GBP and 3% against euro, eroding the benefit at the operating margin level. This currency benefit along with a flatter workforce pyramid and improved productivity of fresh hires helped mitigate the impact of normalizing travel and facility expenses and continued headwind from backfilling and retention expenses. Overall, our operating margin expanded by 0.9% sequentially and was at 24%. Looking ahead, we believe the supply side issues have peaked and should start easing in the second half of the year. Net margins were at 18.9%. Effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.7%. Our accounts receivable was at 62 days’ sales outstanding in dollar term, down 1 day compared to Q1. Net cash from operations was at `106.75 billion which is 102.3% of net income. Free cash flow was `100.62 billion. Invested funds as on 30th September stood at `592.9 billion. The Board has recommended an interim dividend of `8 per share. Over to you, Milind. Milind Lakkad: Thank you, Samir. On the people front, our investments in capacity building and organic talent development allowed us to achieve our strong business growth with relatively modest net headcount addition. : Page 2 of 21 Tata Consultancy Services Q2 FY23 Earnings Conference Call October 10, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) In Q2, we added 9,840 employees on a net basis, bringing our workforce strength to 616,171 as on September 30th. It continues to be a very diverse workforce with 157 nationalities represented and with women making 35.7% of its base.

It continues to be a very diverse workforce with 157 nationalities represented and with women making 35.7% of its base. On the learning front, TCS clocked 11.7 million learning hours in Q2, resulting in the acquisition of 1.5 million competencies. Our FY 23 fresher onboarding is proceeding as per plan. In keeping with our culture of being committed to our employees, we have honored all offers we had made and have onboarded 35,000 freshers in H1 and with 20,000 brought onboard in Q2 alone. The TCS employer brand continues to shine strongly helping us attract the best talent across the world. We launched the TCS National Qualifier Test for FY 24 on August 15th and received an overwhelming response with half a million registrants, an all-time high. Industry-wide churn continue to be high in Q2. Our LTM attrition in IT services inched up further to 21.5%. That said, the technology job market which had overheated in the last few quarters has begun to cool off, and compensation expectations of new hires are also becoming more realistic. With supply catching up across the industry, the pressure to poach experienced talent is easing. So, we should start seeing the churn settle in the coming months. Based on the monthly trends, we believe our quarterly annualized attrition figure has peaked in Q2 and should start moderating in the second half. Lastly, we continue to be benchmarked with the best employers globally for our workplace practices, and policies. In Q2, we won more than 50 awards globally across various aspects of HR value chain, including our work towards gender equity. Over to you, NGS for some color on our segments and products and platforms. N G Subramaniam: Thank you, Milind',

All growth numbers are on year-on-year basis and constant currency terms. All our industry verticals grew strongly in Q2. Growth was led by Retail and CPG which grew 22.9% after a similar strong double digit growth last quarter. Growth is being driven by ongoing spending by retailers towards making their supply chains more agile and resilient, and improving the shopping experience for their customers. We've also seen an uptick in the travel, transportation and hospitality sector, driven by increased investment in resilient operations. Communications and Media grew 18.7% driven by investments around 5G and delivering personalized offerings to consumers. : Page 3 of 21 Tata Consultancy Services Q2 FY23 Earnings Conference Call October 10, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) Technology and Services vertical grew 15.9% while Manufacturing as well as Life Sciences and Healthcare both grew 14.5%. BFSI, our largest vertical grew 13.1%, powered by strong spending on cloud, data analytics and customer experience. Let me now walk you through the growth figures by geography. Among major markets, North America led with 17.6% growth, UK grew 14.8% while Continental Europe grew 14.1%.

In these two decades, our business across the region has grown significantly, catering to the local market, as well as serving as a near shore center for North American clients. Moving on to our Products and Platforms, they did really well in Q2. Ignio™, our cognitive automation software suite signed up four new customers and three clients went live during the quarter. TCS filed two patents around ignio during the quarter and was granted one. The market demand for ignio-trained professionals continue to grow. The number of ignio trained professionals now stands at 16,398. The number of ignio certified professionals is at 6,984 to-date. A large American technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, online services, and mobile phone manufacturing extended ignio AIOps’ event management capabilities to their supply chain.

We onboarded a top five pharma major on our Supply Management Platform, part of the CCT suite, to deliver real-time insights into patient medication adherence. TCS TwinX™, our AI-based digital twin solution, continue to gain ground in various industries, helping clients carry out complex what-if analysis and take informed business decisions. In Q2, we had two wins and three go lives for the TwinX platform. TCS Optumera™, our AI-powered retail merchandising suite went live with two of our clients. TCS iON™ had eight wins in this quarter and is seeing increasing demand and familiarity among educators for the ability to author question papers and auto or manually mark responses. In Q2, we served 150 assessment customers and administered 300 exams to around 6.6 million candidates. Over 1,170 corporates now leverage the TCS National Qualifier Test as their entry level recruitment platform and over 3,150 candidates have gotten placed till date. TCS' MasterCraft had 23 new wins this quarter, including 10 new clients and 13 renewals. In terms of client metrics, these metrics are an important validation of our customer- centric business model.

Despite that headwind, we have good additions in every revenue bucket in Q2 compared to the year ago. We added five more clients in the $100 million plus band, bringing the total to 59. We added 10 more clients in the $50 million band, bringing the total to 124. We added 36 more clients in the $20 million plus band, bringing the total to 283. We added 38 more clients in the $10 million plus band, bringing the total to 455. 41 more clients were added in the $5 million band, bringing the total to 650 and 72 more clients in the $1 million plus band, bringing the total to 1,210. Overall, it has been a very satisfying quarter from an operations perspective. Let me now request Rajesh to speak on the demand drivers during the quarter. Rajesh Gopinathan: Thank you, NGS. Before I get into the demand drivers, let me spend a minute talking about the demand environment and mood among clients. Despite growing news flow around a possible economic slowdown across the world and client concerns over how that might affect their businesses, we haven't seen any change in their spending on us so far. As you could see from the growth figures, demand for our services continues to be strong in Q2 across all verticals and all markets even in Continental Europe and UK, where the pessimism levels are at the highest. Project ramp-ups proceeded as scheduled, and we're not seeing any delays or cancellations. Deal closures also remained strong in Q2",

Project ramp-ups proceeded as scheduled, and we're not seeing any delays or cancellations. Deal closures also remained strong in Q2. That is not to say that the deteriorating macro had no impact at all. Clients have become more cautious when committing to longer-term investments. Some of the larger transformation programs are seeing prioritization of projects that offer quicker wins versus those with longer term paybacks. Many of our clients are also working on plans for various economic scenarios for next year. We have also seen some sporadic instances of delayed decision-making on new deals. Those apart, clients have been telling us that even if their business outlook changes over the next few months for the worst, technology will be one of the last areas to be impacted. The big driver of demand in this quarter was the continued investment by our clients on cloud transformation. The scale, breadth and depth of our cloud expertise, deep domain knowledge, strong partnership credentials with the hyperscalers and our portfolio of : Page 6 of 21 Tata Consultancy Services Q2 FY23 Earnings Conference Call October 10, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) intellectual property on the cloud, make us one of the largest beneficiaries of this opportunity. We are now seeing client focus shift to execution of the transformation agendas announced earlier, and this plays to our strengths.

#                      'We are now seeing client focus shift to execution of the transformation agendas announced earlier, and this plays to our strengths. We have seen instances where clients are unable to leverage the flex capacity of the cloud until they shift a larger portion of the workload and they are seeking our help in accelerating that move. Further, many organizations which rushed to move their workloads to the cloud without sufficient planning and controls in place, are now discovering that they are not only losing out on the economic benefits of the hyperscaler clouds, but are actually incurring higher costs than they did with their own data centers. Such clients are very open to our proactive proposals with our FinOps advisory offerings to help optimize their spends on the cloud, and our cloud orchestration services powered by TCS Cloud Exponence™, our multi-tenant cloud delivery platform to help them seamlessly and optimally manage multiple environments spanning public, private and hybrid clouds. We won several cloud transformation deals in Q2. For example, we were selected by a leading American biopharmaceutical company as a transformation partner to modernize their technology estate. We will build for them a next-gen operating model leveraging cloud, agile, DevSecOps, and cloud-native technologies that will help them enhance enterprise resilience, accelerate the pace of innovation and improve the customer experience. In addition to the migration of workloads to the cloud, several clients engaged us in Q2 to architect advanced analytics, leveraging cloud native capabilities to help them launch new products, understand the customers better, and deliver a richer customer experience. For example, for a large UK bank, we proposed a transformation solution entailing the design of an enterprise data fabric architecture that enables advanced analytics at scale, leveraging our deep contextual knowledge, portfolio of tools and accelerators and hyperscaler cloud expertise',

Similarly, a leading American hotel and motel operator, engaged us to develop an advanced cloud analytics solution to help transform customer and agent experience by consolidating and harmonizing data from across their enterprise. : Page 7 of 21 Tata Consultancy Services Q2 FY23 Earnings Conference Call October 10, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) The economic uncertainty is also resulting in greater interest from clients in our Machine First™ approach to transform their IT and business operating models. You might recall from my earlier commentary on this topic, that this approach basically entails embedding AI and machine learning deep within an enterprise to create leaner, more agile and resilient operations, which can flex up or down depending on the business environment, and whose efficiency gains can fund some of their front office transformation initiatives. We had several such wins this quarter of which I will mention only two. We were engaged by Xerox for their enterprise-wide business transformation journey to enhance their competitiveness and power their growth. TCS’ Cognitive Business Operations, and Xerox’ Centers of Excellence embarked on multiple transformation initiatives across the various business functions, including finance and accounting.

TCS’ Cognitive Business Operations, and Xerox’ Centers of Excellence embarked on multiple transformation initiatives across the various business functions, including finance and accounting. The digital transformation program powered by TCS Cognix has automated the processing, improving speed, accuracy and throughput. Its AI-powered dashboards and various analytical models equip the finance function with intelligent and real-time insights for decision-making. This has resulted in a positive impact on the cash flow, and significantly improved operational efficiency. A European industrial tools manufacturer chose us to transform their service desk operations. We will leverage cognitive technologies and implement a leading employee experience platform for auto-healing of user issues and improve user experience. Coming to the third driver of demand, it is what we broadly classify as growth and transformation. What stands out in these engagements is the value of our deep contextual knowledge of our clients’ business and technology landscapes and our highly collaborative inside-out approach to transformation. This results in impactful transformation solutions that don't face traditional organizational resistance to change and get us much appreciation from the management teams. Let me illustrate this with three examples: We have been working closely for over a decade with a leading bank in North America that services the startup and innovation industry.

This entailed reimagination of the overall business framework for the treasury and capital markets swap dealer business for the bank. TCS led the discussions with the bank to define the target state business architecture, solution architecture and implementation roadmap. We brought in actionable points of view, best practices recommendation, and presented a tactical as well as a strategic approach to the solution implementation. As a business outcome, the real-time liquidity monitoring and management is expected to reduce the nostro buffer for the bank by more than 40% and ensure compliance to enhanced regulatory requirements. The target reference architecture is expected to bring down the time-to-market by 10% to 15%.

The solution was co-created with the client and is now part of the TCS ADD platform. We are also a strategic partner supporting the digital surgical platform for their medtech segment. The platform is in an early stage of evolution and has foundational capabilities of edge connectivity, analytics and AI suite with an objective to provide capabilities to launch specific use cases for connected digital surgeries. A third instance is where TCS led the transformation of the space, range and display capabilities for Marks & Spencer, enabling it to improve customer choice while optimizing the range of products based on local consumer demand. This is achieved through automated data-driven range decisions, and by producing over 12,000 live store-specific planograms. By enhancing the accuracy of floor plans and equipment into the planogram fixtures, our solution ensured that the optimized display plan could be faithfully implemented in the stores.

One such industry that is going through a tremendous amount of technology-led transformation is the utility sector, at an industry level, as well as at the level of individual enterprises. Almost every quarter, I've shared examples of transformation work we're doing in this sector. In Q2 last year, I'd spoken about five-minute settlement solution that we built for the Australian Energy Market Operator, that is helping spur innovation in that market and lower costs for consumers. This time I want to highlight a transformation in the UK gas market. The UK energy regulator introduced a program for faster and more reliable supplier switching option for energy consumers with a new centralized switching service, to facilitate competition and deliver better outcome for consumers. TCS worked with Xoserve, the central data service provider for the UK gas market to design and deliver a complex solution that transforms core business processes like switching and contract creation, settlement, device update and maintenance, meter reading, billing, delivery and others, leveraging a leading hyperscaler ERP solution. TCS’ deep domain expertise and technology expertise were critical in delivering the solution capable of processing 150,000 switches in under 30 minutes. The solution allowed the transition and migration of 24 million UK gas meters’ data to enable CSS switching activity. The solution went live in Q2. With the new solution, the 14-days that it took to switch a supplier has now been reduced to just one day",

With the new solution, the 14-days that it took to switch a supplier has now been reduced to just one day. Similarly, last quarter I'd spoken about a Fortune 500 electric and gas utility that partnered with us to launch a new business model to generate new revenue streams based on home energy services. Let me share one more example along similar lines. Engie France, the leading utility retailer is transforming its business model by expanding from a commodity-based business of gas and electricity to a new service-oriented model of smart home solutions, offering to drive energy efficiency for consumers and ensuring sustainability. TCS partnered with Engie right from the conceptualization, design and proofs of concept. Leveraging our deep domain knowledge and expertise in core ERP, we developed a solution for subscription in CRM with incentive and promotion management, and integrated billing for service and energy-commodity charges in a consolidated invoice. : Page 10 of 21 Tata Consultancy Services Q2 FY23 Earnings Conference Call October 10, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) This offering has been launched in the market and has received a very positive response, improving customer satisfaction and growing market share for Engie.

Let me share three such examples of business transformation solutions that went live in Q2. An American multinational conglomerate engaged us to build a comprehensive asset performance management solution that they will market to their industrial and warehouse customers. The cloud-based IoT platform we built for them ingests real-time data from various assets and enables new value-added services around improved asset visibility, monitoring capabilities, and predictive insights, leading to improved asset performance, optimized operations, increased plant availability and higher throughput for their end-customers, and new revenue streams for our client. Ingram Micro, one of the largest technology distributors in the US, engaged us as a partner to power their pivot into e-commerce and achieve their mission to transform from a traditional distributor to a platform company that does distribution. We built them a new digital experience ecosystem platform connecting their customers, vendors and associates. It reimagines the customer journey, making it frictionless and highly personalized, with conversational experiences, and an AI-powered recommendation engine that enables intelligent bundled offers. Similarly, Tapestry Inc. – a leading New York-based house of iconic accessories and lifestyle brands, consisting of Coach, Kate Spade, & Stuart Weitzman – partnered with TCS to drive their omnichannel modernization, implementing order management for its brands to help increase net incremental growth and improve customer satisfaction. This partnership created a flawless omnichannel order fulfillment and improved customer journey experience.

Coming to our order book, we again had a strong set of deal wins in Q2, amounting to a TCV of $8.1 billion. By vertical, BFSI had a TCV of $2.3 billion, while retail order book stood at $1.6 billion. The TCV of deals signed in North America stood at $4.3 billion. Interestingly, while the pessimism around the macro is possibly highest in UK and Europe, our order book there is stronger in Q2 than in Q1. : Page 11 of 21 Tata Consultancy Services Q2 FY23 Earnings Conference Call October 10, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) While the strength of our order book as well as the pipeline for Q3 is somewhat comforting, given the volatility, we remain very vigilant and are staying very close to our clients. With that, we can open the line for questions. Moderator: We will now begin with the question-and-answer session. First question is from the line of Kumar Rakesh from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Kumar Rakesh: My first question was specifically around European geography and UK. In this quarter on a CC YoY basis also, we saw a pretty robust growth of 14% to 15%, which is a higher growth compared to how we reported last quarter. One of our larger peers who recently reported also saw pretty strong growth in Europe and talked about double-digit growth in their November quarter as well",

One of our larger peers who recently reported also saw pretty strong growth in Europe and talked about double-digit growth in their November quarter as well. Given the fear around macro economy being pretty severe in that geography, what is driving this much stronger growth in Europe despite those fears? Is there some structural growth drivers which we are now seeing in the European geography or the impact could potentially come with a lag? Rajesh Gopinathan: Rakesh, we have always maintained, and it has been borne out through the pandemic, that technology is at the core of solutions both on the growth side as well as on the consolidation and optimization side. So, technologies remains very core to business agendas for our clients across the full spectrum, across all markets. And we are benefiting from participating in that cycle. It’s very difficult for us to zoom out and comment on the macro situation. We can only tell you what is going on with the specific clients that we have. We are in no better position than you... you are, in fact, in a much better position than us to be able to take a call on the macro. This is what we see and we are running with it. In individual customer conversations, opportunities exist, but caution also exists. I called that out last time also that in executive conversations, people are talking about caution. We need to remain vigilant to see whether that will translate into the budgeting and planning cycle for next year, and what that implies for overall demand. We'll have to play it by the ear as it comes",

Kumar Rakesh: My second question was around heading into December quarter, which is usually seasonally weak, are we getting any sense how the seasonality this time around? Could there be higher than usual seasonality or could it be the usual seasonality? In interacting with clients, how are they looking at their next year budget? Any sense on that could be very helpful. : Page 12 of 21 Tata Consultancy Services Q2 FY23 Earnings Conference Call October 10, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) Rajesh Gopinathan: Leaving aside the fact that Europe is in a fairly volatile situation, and this winter is going to be critical in Europe, our conversations with clients indicate regular seasonality. We have had extensive client interactions – we hosted our North American clients at our annual TCS Summit, and also had a series of client events across Europe. So, overall, I don't think there is any change to the seasonality patterns that we are picking up. However, this does not address the possibility of some severe shifts in Europe during the winter. Kumar Rakesh: And client interactions on next year's budget planning? Rajesh Gopinathan: Too early to take a call. We don't know. I mean, we get to hear of it only in the second or third month of the year, as it starts actually translating into projects. At this stage, we don't have visibility. As I said in the last call also, there is a cautionary stance that customers are talking about. They're talking about scenario planning. And the scenarios are more weighted on the downside than on the upside",

Sandip Agarwal: Although, you know it is very hard to comment on how things will pan out, but, Rajesh, is there any kind of caution which you're seeing in your discussions with the client, particularly from the US geography, because individuals in UK and Europe, traditionally we have seen the economic pressure generally results into some help for outsourcing because it is more cost effective in the past, but that correlation doesn't show up immediately in the US. So, what are you seeing, is there any kind of caution which clients are highlighting on the fears of recession or you're seeing any action into the direction when they are ordering? Have you seen any kinds of delays or anything which makes us more vigilant? Rajesh Gopinathan: In US we've not picked up any threats in terms of caution, I mean extra caution than what is normally expected. So, US is not showing anything particularly concerning. People are overall continuing to invest and normal seasonality should apply. Otherwise, we are seeing a fairly strong environment in US. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah from Equirus Securities. Please go ahead. Sandeep Shah: Rajesh, last time in this 1Q conference call, you said that the trend of multi-tower outsourcing deals or multi-service transformational deals are going up, and you started signing more number of such deals",

Operating model transformation as a demand driver has very strong trend and we are seeing multiple opportunities across all markets on operating model transformation. Operating model transformation is being characterized by a few very distinct points. One is the shift to what we call a vertical operating model, or a product-centric operating model, where tech and ops is being aligned very closely to business units and to business outcomes. The other big one is, of course, the adoption of agile and lean into everything in operations, even more importantly, significant leverage of our Cognix platform, which is powered by MFDM™. The embedding of automation at a granular level across enterprise’s operation suite, both on the tech side as well as on the operations side, is also core to the operating model transformation that we see. So, this kind of enterprise-wide operating model transformations continue to be a big driver of demand. The couple of examples that I had shared, Xerox and one of the others are examples of that",

And that demand trend I think is quite strong and will continue to remain strong into the foreseeable future. Sandeep Shah: Is it fair to say in terms of what you said in an earlier question, in the second half seasonality could be normal especially in the US, but there could be some issues in the Europe and there could be significant shifts if the macro issues goes more concerning versus what you anticipate now? Rajesh Gopinathan: It's a prudent assumption. But from our side, we will remain focused on the opportunity on the ground, and we will deal with it one opportunity at a time. But at an overall level, it would be prudent to assume so. Sandeep Shah: And a last question to CFO as well. In this quarter, is there 100% variable pay being paid or there is some adjustment looking at the macro issues and could be an impending showdown, especially in the Europe? Milind Lakkad: We are going to pay 100% of variable pay for 70% of our employees. The remaining 30% will get paid based on the business rate performance. Sandeep Shah: This is for 2Q or this is for the rest of the FY'23? Milind Lakkad: No, no, this is for Q2. : Page 14 of 21 Tata Consultancy Services Q2 FY23 Earnings Conference Call October 10, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) Moderator: The next question is from the line of Ravi Menon from Macquarie.

Please go ahead. Ravi Menon: Wanted to check about the strong additions in the 1 million and 5 million. I know we did make organizational change, but I guess it's too soon to see the impact of that. So, should we think of this as change in your go-to-market and trying to close a lot more of the smaller deals and is there more demand for digital transformation from the smaller firms because there might be laggards in this transformation? Rajesh Gopinathan: No, Ravi, this is just a bit of the impact of the currency volatility that you are seeing. Our client metric in non-US markets, APAC, LATAM, parts of Europe, etc., are more weighed towards smaller sized customers. And when we report those revenues in US dollar terms, they are getting significantly impacted by the strength of the US currency vis-à-vis the local currencies in these markets. So, although our business response is not going down, in the translation of revenues into US dollar terms, it is showing up that way. At the bottom of the pyramid, the impact is a lot more, because the non-US market is more concentrated at the bottom of the pyramid. So, it's a bit of a mathematics. We're also internally debating what is the best way to communicate this metric. But we also don't want to react immediately to this extreme cross currency volatility that we saw in Q2. But we'll put our heads together as to how to communicate this better in the future if required",

Ravi Menon: And how should we think about the lateral hiring, being a little lower than the revenue growth, is just a reflection of expectation that the worst of the supply side challenges are behind us, and we can now improve utilization or should we think of this as linked to slightly softer demand visibility, or maybe a combination of both? Rajesh Gopinathan: Ravi, your question was about the headcount growth, right? Ravi Menon: Yes, that's a little lower than the revenue growth, I mean, we have seen that – Rajesh Gopinathan: Ravi, we have been significantly investing into headcount addition through last year. As you know, our headcount growth was close to 20% against revenue growth of about 15%, and that we have built up a fair amount of headroom. So, you should expect that we will be using that lever a bit more as we go into this year, and try to balance our overall headcount to our overall revenue from a longer-term perspective.

Please go ahead. Gaurav Rateria: Two questions. Firstly, is it fair to assume that the book-to-bill in Europe would have improved on a quarter-on-quarter basis, basis the commentary that you made and how the pipeline replenishment has happened in Europe after the deal wins concluded? Rajesh Gopinathan: We typically desist from giving you incremental metrics, because that sets a precedent. But when you take Europe and UK together, yes, the book-to-bill has improved. But the actual growth of the pipeline is more than the growth of our qualified pipeline. So, you are seeing some amount of elongation of the deal pipeline between total pipeline and the qualified pipeline. Now, these numbers are volatile because it can change depending on how the environment changes, but that's where we are. Gaurav Rateria: Secondly, in last quarter, you talked about revenue productivity getting impacted as you created capacity. So, has that got sort of sorted out and you saw some improvement in revenue productivity, which also had margins and should this be seen as one of the levers for second half in terms of margin performance on revenue productivity side? Rajesh Gopinathan: The way to think about is it is not in terms of a short-term margin lever, but as a strategic call we have taken to significantly expand our employee onboarding, especially on the entry-level employees. We had hired close to 120,000 freshers last year and invested into that pool given the longer-term visibility that we have on demand",
#                      "We had hired close to 120,000 freshers last year and invested into that pool given the longer-term visibility that we have on demand. We will tweak our employee model on an ongoing basis looking at the demand. So, that is a reasonable expectation, but our overall hiring model is predicated on much longer cycles rather than on short term, quarter-on-quarter adjustments. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Manik Taneja from JM Financial. Please go ahead. Manik Taneja: Just wanted to pick your brains about the aspect that historically what we've seen is that we've improved our margins through periods of slow growth. Do you envisage something similar playing out going forward as well? And if you could also help us with the margin levers that you think will play out in the near-term given the fact that you've suggested that pricing increases is not universal and is still happening only in certain parts of the book. Rajesh Gopinathan: If we have strong visibility of low revenue growth, and we become much more careful and optimize it, but I think at this stage, I don't think we are at that point for us to be able to make a comment on that. So, margin optimization comes in more when there is good visibility on stable demand environments, and we use those periods to clean up on the margin side. Right now, whether we are at an inflection point or not, we'll know only in a : Page 16 of 21 Tata Consultancy Services Q2 FY23 Earnings Conference Call October 10, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) few quarters’ time. Otherwise, we'll continue to stay in the growth and investment mode. But short-term margin levers, I will hand it to Samir to talk about. Samir Seksaria: In the short-term between the quarters, we would expect to focus on our operating metrics. Utilization will continue to provide opportunity for optimization. Realization has improved this quarter and we’ll expect to leverage further on that. We will also enhance our rigor on execution",

Apurva Prasad: Rajesh, while H1 bookings has held up above the 7 billion to 9 billion midpoint, how should we be thinking bookings trajectory for H2, more around the replenishment of the funnel of the qualified deal pipeline, any progression around that? Rajesh Gopinathan: Apurva, difficult to say. We are running at 1.2 times book-to-bill which is a fairly healthy rate to run at. And we can take a bit of volatility on that on a quarter-on-quarter basis. So, to take a near-term call on what will happen next quarter or the quarter after that, difficult for us to do. And more importantly, it does not have a significant impact on our business model, neither in our planning cycles or in our execution cycle. So, our focus, of course, will be to maximize and capture as much as we can. But it's not really a big factor that changes any of our planning scenarios. Apurva Prasad: Just to follow up on that, Rajesh, so this 1.2 book-to-bill from a medium-term perspective, is that the number to build? Rajesh Gopinathan: Apurva, I don't want to get drawn out on that",

And if you could also help us with the hyperscaler certification numbers, the number that was 71,000 last quarter? Rajesh Gopinathan: Learning hours to some extent is impacted by the volume of freshers coming in. As you know, we had a very large volume of freshers coming in over the last couple of quarters which has moderated over the last two quarters. So, that will have a flow through impact on the learning hours. As we went in through the reorganization, that also had some impact. But at an aggregate level, our focus on reskilling and training and investing into people continues at scale and there is absolutely no change in it. Apurva Prasad: And hyperscaler certification number? : Page 17 of 21 Tata Consultancy Services Q2 FY23 Earnings Conference Call October 10, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) Rajesh Gopinathan: I don't know whether we give that out.

Bharat Sheth: Rajesh, can you give a little bit more color on products and platforms, which I understand is contributing around mid-teen kind of total revenue and since we are moving towards more on migrating to SaaS business, is the revenue recognition a bit slow and when do we expect that to catch up, and what could be the margin lever in this business? N G Subramaniam: Overall, the products and platforms business is quite stable. The number of opportunities that come our way across verticals and across the solutions that we have is looking good. The business model has certainly transformed itself into a pure play SaaS-based operating environment. Without any exceptions, every opportunity that we bid for, is for a SaaS-based offering. So, if you really look at it, we have also transitioned, I should say beautifully, from a license-based, on-prem, AMC kind of a model to a pay-per-use SaaS model in the last two years. All our products and platforms are now available on a cloud platform. It's either installed in our own cloud environment, or with some of the platforms, we've also chosen to operate in a hyperscaler cloud. In either of these cases, the key thing is that the SaaS model is prevailing. The way that we monitor it now is with the ARR or the annual recurring revenue that is contracted. That is the metric we are monitoring and with which we are measuring our own performance, as opposed to the earlier way of what is the license fee, what is the AMC, what is the services element to it and so on and so on. So, it is maturing",

That is the metric we are monitoring and with which we are measuring our own performance, as opposed to the earlier way of what is the license fee, what is the AMC, what is the services element to it and so on and so on. So, it is maturing. And our products and platforms business itself has matured with the whole environment of onboarding the clients on a single instance SaaS. Some of the things that we are seeing developed is the data privacy element, the data localization element. For example, in Europe, the data residency increasingly is becoming a necessity to be located in Europe. These are the things that are getting sharpened as I speak. But overall, it's a good growing business and the ARR metric is going to become increasingly relevant. At some stage, we hope we'll be able to start reporting separately on ARR basis as we mature our model. Bharat Sheth: And what are the margin levers you have in this business? : Page 18 of 21 Tata Consultancy Services Q2 FY23 Earnings Conference Call October 10, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) N G Subramaniam: Margins essentially depend on the business volume of transactions that they are going to put in. It varies. Efficiency is going to come from the fact that we're not going to be doing too much customization. People are going to be using the products and platforms more as a COTS model. So, you don't have to maintain too many customer-specific customizations at any point in time. That is going to be run efficiently. Secondly, our own support model is going to be heavily optimized, and it's going to be a lot more standardized. Thirdly, the product release cycles are going to be a lot more standard, and we will be able to define it rather than defined by customers at every instance. These are the things that I see at an operating level",

These are the things that I see at an operating level. And as we add more optionality to the offerings, in the sense that, look, I can give you the standard platform, but there are certain additional services that I can bring in, for example, client reporting. Either customer can take data and then do it themselves, or for example, as a value added service we can provide client reporting separately. Or a certain amount of analytics they can do themselves or they can come and leverage our value-added services for that. So, it’s a standard service, value added service, efficiencies that come through a standard way of product management, product releases and upgrades, all this will contribute to the margins. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Rahul Jain from Dolat Capital. Please go ahead. Rahul Jain: Just on the subcon side and on the global hiring side, subcon cost has been going up, of course, for the supply side factors. But given the expectation of a relatively better supply environment in the global market, is that going to change the subcon cost as well as direct hiring outside India? Samir Seksaria: I'll answer first on the subcontractor cost. So, as you would have seen, subcontractor cost has started trending downwards. Most of the subcontractor cost increase was on account of two factors. With borders opening up and visa availability in most countries improving, we would expect subcontractor costs to start trending down. Also, as the headwinds from attrition eases, we would expect the use of subcontractors also to trend downwards",

This could be a good alternative to manage the demand and supply situation better, or it should ease out irrespective of it? Samir Seksaria: We will try to balance it and it would be a dynamic thing. If demand continues to be strong, we would try to capture the demand first, rather than optimizing the subcontractor cost. That's the lever which we know how to use and will optimize as and when need arises. Moderator: Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. I now hand the conference over to the management for closing comments. Rajesh Gopinathan: Thank you, operator. We had a very good second quarter growing 18% in INR terms and 15.4% in constant currency. Our growth was strong across all our industry verticals and all our markets. Importantly, we had a good order book once again. While clients continue to worry about the uncertain economic environment and are planning for different scenarios, we are not seeing any material change in client spending behavior. There are some sporadic instances of delayed decision making",

While clients continue to worry about the uncertain economic environment and are planning for different scenarios, we are not seeing any material change in client spending behavior. There are some sporadic instances of delayed decision making. But those happen at normal times too, so it's hard to pin this down specifically to the economic environment. Our operating margin expanded sequentially to 24% and our net margin expanded to 18.9%. On the people front, the capacity we built up over the last few quarters and our investment in organic talent development is helping us meet this demand. Our attrition inched up to 21.5% in IT services on LTM basis. However, we believe the situation is easing, and that our quarterly annualized attrition has peaked this quarter, and will start tapering off going forward. With that, we wrap up our call. Thank you all for joining us on this call today. Enjoy the rest of your evening or day and stay safe. Moderator: Thank you members of the management.

#     chunk_list=['Management Discussion and Analysis.Overview.We believe that the telecom industry in India is going through a once in a lifetime transformation and we are truly well poised to capitalize on this with our industry leading position in customers, revenues, best in class spectrum and network assets..The Indian Telecom Sector is the second largest in the world and has been growing rapidly. The pace of transformation of the telecom market over the course of years has been staggering. Of the 1.3 Bn addressable population in India, there are only 0.7 Bn unique connections today, presenting a large residual opportunity in the sector. Further, at 58.7%, rural teledensity also has massive potential to grow and enable the masses to realize the Digital India vision..In. Africa, macroeconomic factors turned favorable with stabilization in prices of crude oil and commodities. Airtel remains committed to Africa and with consolidation in 2 countries (Ghana and Rwanda), a better industry structure is emerging. Low banking penetration, ~20% smartphone penetration, and exponential data traffic growth are creating massive opportunities for telecom operators in Africa. Airtel is creating a strong foundation for a solid, sustainable business in Africa. Twin engines of data and mobile money, underpinned by strict cost controls have strengthened our competitive position during the year..In a mobile first market like India, with massive data offtake, telecom operators are transforming from pure play mobile to being a digital services provider - integrating connectivity and content across various screens. The role of a smartphone is emerging as more than just a connection. It is leading to a convergence of connectivity, entertainment, education, and banking.',
#                 'Economic Review.The sector is witnessing exponential data traffic growth led by increased smartphone penetration, cheaper data tariffs, and proliferation of regional content. Though the mobile broadband penetration is ~30% today, it is expected to grow manifold and make India the second largest smartphone market (ahead of US and just behind China). Further, data traffic is expected to grow 7 fold from 2016-2021. To ensure a market leading position, Airtel continues to invest heavily in providing high speed broadband networks in the country and spent ~ 240,000 Mn this year in capital expenditure..Global Review.Globally, 2017 witnessed strong growth across most advanced and emerging economies aided by rebound in investment and trade, accommodative government policies, improved confidence, favorable financing costs, rising profits, and improved business sentiments. Global growth is projected to be 3.1% during 2018..Global goods trade volumes have gathered significant momentum since mid-2016, following two years of marked weakness. Momentum was sustained throughout 2017. The recovery in global trade is connected to a cyclical upturn in global manufacturing, which was encouraged by stronger capital spending. Services trade also recovered in 2017, albeit at a slower pace..Large opportunities exist in non-wireless space of the telecom industry as well. With less than 5% of the households connected by fixed broadband, single digit SMB (Small and Medium Businesses) connectivity, large cash based economy, and low digital TV penetration, Airtel with an integrated suite of offerings is very well positioned to catalyse the digital transformation of the country..Growth in 2017 in advanced economies rebounded to more than 2%, driven by a pickup in capital spending, a turnaround in inventories, and strengthening external demand. In the US, economic data largely printed on a positive note, powering the Fed to raise rates in its last policy meeting by 25bps to 1.50- 1.75%. The U.S.',
#                 'tax reform and associated fiscal stimulus are expected to raise U.S. growth going forward. Policy stimulus and strengthening global demand, along with private sector credit growth to respond to the simulative stance of European Central Bank led to markedly stronger than expected improvement in Euro Area. The unemployment rate reached its lowest level since 2009..FY 2017-18 was a decisive year for the Indian Telecom Sector on numerous counts. Industry revenue table continued to remain under pressure, with the launch of aggressive price offerings by the latest entrant. The continuing disruption hastened consolidation and operators with stretched balance sheets found it difficult to survive. The industry has moved towards a 3+1 structure with early signs of SIM consolidation. In this phase of high competitive intensity, Airtel’s priorities center around growing market share, stripping out costs, and improving margins. Putting customers at the heart is the key foundation of our strategy and we continue to maintain network leadership and provide brilliant customer experience to our more than 300 Mn customers..(Source: IMF April 2018)',
#                 "Indian Economy.India’s macroeconomic fundamentals remained strong throughout the year. India’s growth story showcases improving growth dynamics and domestic consumption with supportive tailwinds from global growth and exports. India is expected to be the top three economic powers of the world in next 10-15 years. Going ahead strong private consumption project high growth rate in India..Growth in emerging markets rose to ~4.3% in 2017, reflecting firming activity in commodity exporters and continued growth in commodity importers. Most emerging markets benefitted from improvements in exports. East and South Asia accounted for nearly half of the global growth as both regions continued to develop at a rapid pace..2018 will continue to be a year of broad based economic growth both in Developed and Developing Economies. With easing financial conditions and fiscal support, strong expansion is expected in the world economy..*GDP growth rates at constant (2011-12) prices.Economic scenario improved with investments in various sectors of the economy. Key events during the year were:.a) Ratings Upgrade: Moody's upgraded India’s sovereign rating with a stable economic outlook. There was a progress in structural reforms. b) Implementation of GST: GST will help reduce internal barriers to trade, increase efficiency and improve tax compliance. c) Bank recapitalization: To encourage private participation thus boosting growth. d) Improved Ranking: India jumped 30 places to include itself among top 100 companies under World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business ranking..India’s Foreign Direct Investment inflows were bullish with maximum contribution from services, computer software and hardware, telecommunication, trading and automobiles.

India is expected to achieve upper middle income status on the back of digitization, globalization and new economic reforms.',
#                 'Africa Economy.Aided by strong global growth, higher commodity prices, and improved market access, sub-Saharan Africa is expected to grow by 3.4% during 2018 as compared to 2.8% a year ago. Better terms of trade contributed to narrowing of current account deficits in most resource intensive countries, but demand compression also played a role in few resulting in non-uniform growth across the region. Portfolio flows fueled stock markets, however they were restricted to economic hubs. Although growth impetus stems mainly from improved commodity prices, countries are making structural transformations as well..The upward momentum in global economic growth is likely to be sustained, which will continue to create a supportive environment for commodity prices. The Balance of Payments problems that plagued many of the continent’s commodity- exporting countries are mostly behind, partly due to recovering commodity prices and some bold policy measures taken in some countries. There are still signs of long-running structural deficiencies that would likely restrain the medium-term recovery path. But, overall, the outlook for growth in Africa is positive..There are fundamentally positive dynamics which play in Africa’s favour, including a growing labour force, increased urbanisation and advanced technology. Africa has the potential to emerge as one of the world’s most productive and dynamic economies where the telecom sector continues to witness a revolution in the areas of data and mobile commerce..Mobile has become a platform of choice for creating, distributing and consuming innovative digital solutions in Africa. This scenario is also leading to a tech start-up ecosystem in the region. Mobile devices are now the primary means through which about 80% of internet users in sub-Saharan Africa access the internet.',

#                 'Megatrends that drive our business:.a) Convergence of payments via smartphones is driving financial inclusion. Demonetisation and cashless initiative has pushed the digital payments in India significantly. Telecom industry, with an expansive distribution network is best placed to capture this opportunity. According to a white paper by ACI Worldwide along with AGS Transact Technologies (AGSTTL), digital transactions in India could be worth USD 1 Tn annually by 2025, with four out of every five transactions being done digitally. The user base for digital transactions in India is currently close to 90 Mn, but could triple to 300 Mn by 2020 as new users from rural and semi-urban areas enter the market, the report said. b) Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 338.4 Mn mobile money accounts which grew by 18.4% YoY. A steady uptick in active customers, transactions and direct revenue are expected to drive the digital transactions further. C) Increased penetration of affordable devices, combined with cloud computing, analytics and rising consumer expectations is driving the rapid growth of the IOT market. The IOT market in India is poised to reach USD 15 Bn by 2020, accounting for nearly 5% of total global market. Telecom will play a critical role in providing connectivity and solutions in this market. Number of M2M connections in Africa is expected to reach 26 Mn by 2020. d) Convergence of fixed and wireless technologies iS becoming more tangible with improvements in handsets, increased data speed, and development of backhaul. e) Indian smartphone market witnessed a 14% annual growth with a total shipment of 124 Mn units in 2017, expected to reach 500-600 Mn by 2020. f) The number of internet users in India will reach 500 Mn by June 2018, rising by 11.34% from 481 Mn users in 2016.

The increasing usage of digital service will push the consumption through Over the top (OTT) platform in near future. h) Smartphone connections in sub-Saharan Africa have doubled over the past two years to nearly 200 Mn, accounting for a quarter of mobile connections in 2016. Affordability of new devices and growing second-hand mobile devices market have led to increase in mobile data traffic. i) By 2020, Indiais set to become the world’s youngest country with 64% of its population in the working age group. This demographic potential will offer India an unprecedented edge with increase in mobile data penetration. )) With digitization Phase Ill and IV, DTH operators are likely to benefit from a rising subscriber base and higher market penetration.

The year saw financial stress across the industry ultimately leading to hastening of the eventual consolidation in the industry. The year saw a host of operator shut downs and M&A announcements. This has fast tracked the customer consolidation and consequently the customer base has registered a muted growth of 1.0% in FY 2017-18 vis-a-vis 1,194.58 Mn last year and there has been a marginal decline in the tele-density from 92.98% last year..The sector has witnessed a strong growth of internet users and remains to have world’s second highest number of internet users.

Among the three metros, Delhi tops with 252.93% tele-density. On the other hand, the service areas, such as Bihar (63.12%), Madhya Pradesh (66.99%), Uttar Pradesh (71.21%) and Assam (74.63%) have comparatively low tele-density..Tele Density: India.(Source: Telecom Regulatory Authority of India).While the rural penetration improved during the year and touched 59.05% as on March 31, 2018 vis-a-vis 56.91% as on March 31, 2017, there is still a strong headroom for growth. With urban tele-density of over 160%, customer service and experience will be the key growth drivers in urban areas. With the government’s favourable regulations and_ policies, the fast changing high-speed 4G ecosystem, India’s telecommunication sector is expected to witness a continued surge in data consumption in the coming years..The financial stress across the industry was further exacerbated by the explosion of voice and data traffic and the need to invest to sustain network capacities. The company continued to invest in capex to enhance data capabilities and better customer experience. It remains best placed to capture the ever growing data market.',
