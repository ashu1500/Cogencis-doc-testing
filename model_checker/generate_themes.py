We have with us our Chief Executive Officer - Pieter Elbers and our Chief Financial Officer — Gaurav Negi to discuss the financial performance and are available for the Q&A session.',
                            'Please note that today’s discussion may contain certain statements on our business or financials which may be construed as forward-looking. Our actual results may be materially different from these forward-looking statements.',
                            'The information provided on this call is as of today’s date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. We will upload the transcript of prepared remarks by day end. The transcript of the Q&A session will be uploaded subsequently.',
                            'With this, let me hand over the call to Pieter Elbers. For the first quarter of the financial year 2025, we reported a quarterly total income of 202 billion rupees, which is an increase of 18% as compared to same period last year. In terms of profitability, we reported a profit after tax of 27.3 billion rupees — 2,729 crore rupees with a profit after tax margin of around 14%. With these results, we have reported seven consecutive quarters of profitability.',
                            'We proudly served around 28 million customers during the quarter. And I would like to express my gratitude to each customer for choosing to fly with us. Our customers are the reason we do what we do and we remain committed to making every journey with us a memorable and enjoyable experience. We take into consideration all the feedback that we receive and makes changes to our product & services accordingly. I would like to highlight some of the recent changes that we have made:First of all, we are in the process of launching a tailor-made business product for the nation’s busiest and business routes',
                            'We have introduced a web check-in seat selection feature, specifically for women travellers. We are in the process of revamping our website and mobile application for enhanced customer experience. And, we have added a hotel booking option for our customers on our website and appAdditionally, on the operations side we are constantly expanding the role of technology in order to serve our customers better as recently we became the first airline in India to get approval from the regulator for Electronic Flight Folder that will enable reduction in the time spent on pre-flight preparations, smoother operations and will add to the overall operational efficiency.',
                            'We will be unveiling a lot more details on some of these changes next week during our 18th Anniversary celebration. When we first took to the skies, we envisioned an airline that would not only transport passengers from one destination to another but would also connect the vast and diverse cultures across India. And over the past 18 years, we have grown to the world’s seventh largest airline, in terms of daily departures and have become India’s most preferred airline.',
                            'Since our inception, India’s and IndiGo’s growth story have been closely interlinked. And we believe as India gears up to become the third-largest economy in the world, it’s important that we devise our strategy to, not only capitalize the opportunity, but also stay ahead of the curve. The Indian market, as we shared earlier, is still largely underpenetrated when it comes to air travel. And even more so, when it comes to international air travel. So, there is a buoyant market out there, hand in hand with the growth of the Indian economy.',
                            'With IATA’s 81st AGM to be held in Delhi in 2025, India’s aviation industry potential is being recognized, also at a global stage. And we are proud to be the host airline for IATA AGM next year and look forward to welcoming the global aviation community to our home country.',
                            'Expanding our network is a key part of our growth strategy. And we have added 30 new routes on a year-over-year basis as we fly to more than 540 routes currently. Further, in line with growing demand we are further enhancing our international capacity deployment to Central Asia and as from mid of August we will be flying daily to the cities we added last year - Tashkent, Almaty and Tblisi.',
                            'As guided at the starting of the year, we will continue to add more destinations and frequencies in the coming quarters to grow by early double digits in the financial year 2025. We have the Airbus XLRs joining our fleet next year which will allow us to reach the southern parts of Europe and further into Asia as well. Then to further expand our range, we have the Airbus A350-900 coming in from the year 2027.',
                            'In addition to that, our codeshare networks have been a very important pillar of our international strategy. Our experience of partnerships with multiple global airlines has exposed us to the needs and preferences of international customers, preparing us for the next stage of operations as so that we are able to apply the learnings once we have widebodies. Recently, we have announced codeshare partnership with Japan Airlines, under which Japan Airlines’ customers will be able to seamlessly travel to 14 Indian cities through Delhi and Bengaluru. All of these elements are building blocks of the very same cohesive strategy towards internationalization.',
                            'Operationally, over the past few quarters, as the air traffic in India continues to grow and infrastructure enhancements are being implemented across various stations, we have been experiencing increased block times and congestion. We are working relentlessly and taking all possible internal actions such as adjusting schedules to reassure our customer promises.',
                            'Additionally, due to the unfortunate event of canopy collapse in Delhi’s Terminal 1, we had to shift our operations to other terminals in a very short period of time and very recently the massive IT outage globally, which was not limited to the airlines, impacted hundreds of our flights over a two-day timeframe. IndiGo teams immediately stood up and dealt with the situation to minimize the impact for our customers. And I would like to sincerely thank my 6E colleagues for going above and beyond to serve our customers in these extraordinary times.',
                            'While large global airlines are facing multiple headwinds currently due to various factors. Given the size of the opportunity that India presents, and our clear strategy combined with a strong execution by the IndiGo team I remain confident that we will continue to reach new heights. As we enter the next phase of our growth, we remain committed towards our goal of 2030 and are investing heavily to support our growth plans.',
                            'Let me now hand over the call to Gaurav to discuss the financial performance in more detail. Thank you, Pieter and good evening, everyone. For the quarter ended June 2024, we reported a net profit of 27.3 billion rupees with a net profit margin of 13.9% compared to a net profit of 30.9 billion rupees for the quarter ended June 2023.',
                            'We reported an EBITDAR of 58.1 billion rupees with an EBITDAR margin of around 30 percent compared to an EBITDAR of 52.1 billion rupees for the quarter ended June 2023. On the revenue side, we experienced a similar revenue environment as compared to same period last year as the passenger unit revenue, PRASK, came in at 4.54 rupees. The yields came in at5.24 rupees, an improvement of 1.3 percent as compared to the same period last year which was offset by a marginally lower load factors of around 87%. Our unit revenue, which is RASK, came in at 5.40 rupees, which is around 5.5 percent higher compared to the quarter ended June 2023 primarily driven by accruals of the compensation that we have finalized with the OEM for the AOG.',
                            'On the cost side, the fuel CASK increased by 10.5 percent primarily driven by increase in fuel costs we have witnessed year over yearWhen one reviews the CASK ex fuel we experienced a similar increase of around 11 percent in the June 2024 quarter as compared to same period last year.',
                            'Now excluding the impact of forex, the CASK ex fuel ex forex increased by around 9 percent, compared to the same period last year primarily driven by aircraft grounding related costs, annual contractual escalations, inflationary pressures, annual increments, and the investments we continue to make towards supporting the future growth in areas of digital technology, talent and new initiatives.',
                            'Moving to the grounding of aircraft, the current count of grounded aircraft remains range bound at mid-seventies. We are working with Pratt & Whitney towards constant supply of spare engines and basis the current estimates we expect the groundings to start reducing towards the start of the next year. Further as communicated earlier, during the quarter we have finalized an amendment to the existing agreement with Pratt & Whitney for providing us with a customized compensation in relation to the grounding of aircraft due to spare engine unavailability.',
                            'During the quarter, we inducted 15 aircraft of which 8 are from original order book and remaining 7 were inducted as part of our mitigation measures in the form of damp leases and secondary leases. As of June 30", we have a total of 382 aircraft of which 14 aircraft are on finance leases and 18 aircraft are on damp leases. In addition to this, subject to regulatory approvals we will induct 6 more aircraft from Qatar Airlines for the Doha route on wet or damp lease in the coming quarters.',
                            'As shared previously, in order to diversify our sources of financing we have added 14 aircraft on finance leases in the last three quarters. Going forward, we will continue to further diversify our sources and will add more aircraft on finance leases. The tenure of these finance leases is similar to the operating leases of 8-10 years, and we will have the right to own the assets at the end of the lease term at a nominal price.',
                            'In terms of recognition, in an operating lease we recognize the ROU and the lease liability at a present value of lease payments, which is then depreciated over the lease period and the interest is accrued on the lease liability. Supplementary Rentals & Maintenance is also accrued on the flying hours of the aircraft.',
                            'Whereas, when it comes to finance leases, the full value of the aircraft is capitalized in the ROU, which is then depreciated based on the component accounted in the aircraft value. Similarly, theinterest is also accrued on the full value of the aircraft, but over the lease term. As a result, one will witness a higher allocation of interest and depreciation in the earlier years which will taper down over the lease term and life of the asset. Additionally, in finance leases the maintenance costs are capitalized when the maintenance event is carried out.',
                            'We ended the quarter with a capitalized operating lease liability of 449.6 billion rupees and a total debt, including the capitalized operating lease liability of around 525.3 billion rupees. Our right to use assets at quarter end were 358.6 billion rupees.',
                            'Due to our strong financial performance, our liquidity has further improved as we ended the June quarter with a free cash of 220.9 billion rupees. We continue to utilize part of our free cash towards future growth and our goal to become a 600 plus aircraft airline by the end of the decade.',
                            'With our firm pending orderbook of 975 plus aircraft that will enable us to receive more than one aircraft per week and the mitigation measures we remain firm on our capacity guidance of early double digits for the financial year 2025. And for the seasonally weak second quarter, we are expecting to add around high single digits capacity as compared to the same period last year. Further, on the revenue side basis the early trends of July, we are estimating a stable revenue environment on a passenger unit revenue which is PRASK basis in the second quarter of financial year 2025 as compared to the same period last year.',
                            'We will be turning 18 soon, we are proud of the legacy that we have built, and we are carefully considering the changing needs of our customers and making product advancements accordingly. As we embark on the next chapter of our journey our robust strategy and our improved financial health will provide us with the resources to invest for the future, explore new frontiers and reach greater heights.',
                            'With this, let me hand it back to Richa.'

    indigo_questions_list= ["Now just to clarify on the kind of lease this is. What I understand is if you take a damp lease, that might be for, let's say, 6 months or 1 year or 1.5 years. And you have your normal leases, which are longer term, but generally, you tend to return your aircraft in 6 to 7 years. Now when you have taken these 2 planes, what do you mean by a shorter period? Is it like 3 years, 4 years or even shorter?",
                            'Could you repeat what you said about the recognition of operating lease versus finance lease? And how should we look at it from an accounting perspective impact on depreciation and finance line items?',
                            'This is clear. Gaurav, my second question is again on what the previous participant asked, so in terms of whatever you have accrued so far, since there are still 70 planes which are on lease, why should the amount come off, because the maintenance related to that should also be recognized every quarter, right? So, if you could just explain how this entire compensation would work going forward?',
                            "And just as a follow-up, have you heard anything from the regulators or the government regarding yields? Because there's been some noise in the political arena about the fares and all that. So, any follow-up from the government or the ministry concerned?",
                            "Two questions from my side. The first one on cost. If I see your cost ex of fuel ex of forex, it's gone up by about Rs.0.30 on a Y-o-Y basis. Would the Pratt & Whitney issue be accounting fora minority share of this increase, majority or dominant share of the increase?",
                            'Understood. So, the second question that I had was on the demand environment. The context is that maybe the top 3 airlines in India, the CEOs have basically suggested that air fares are low, both IndiGo, Akasa as well as Air India CEOs. Is the demand environment good enough for the sector to be taking price increases ahead of cost inflation in the next 12 months?',
                            'Sure. One related follow-up is a recognition on the compensation part, which happened. So, you mentioned that there was some recognition which happened in the other operating revenue and some bit of compensation also get adjusted into the supplementary rentals part. And if I remember right, in one of your earlier calls, you had also mentioned that the income gets adjusted in the other income line item. So, can you please explain, I mean, how does the attribution basically happen to each line item?',
                            "Right. And another bookkeeping question, your employee incentives that has been accounted for this quarter? Or is it -- it's not?",
                            "So, first of all, in terms of yield. So, you mentioned that the next quarter yields are going to be flat year-on-year. That confuses me a bit because I think the last year, second quarter, I think the capacity was up almost 20%. And this year, you are guiding much lower capacity growth. And then yet you're expecting a yield, a flattish yield. So, I mean, could you just break it down a bit and give us a bit more colour in terms of are you sort of reducing the fares to inflate the demand? Or is it like how much of it is like underlying yield strength and how much is because of the network mix? So, what exactly happened on the yield? So, if you could break that up and then give a bit more colour, that would be helpful.",
                            "Okay, fine. My second question is about more on the international side. So now, of course, given that you're not very far from taking XLRs' deliveries and then you are also preparing for wide bodies. So, I just want to understand in terms of taking the flight rights and especially the sixth freedom right, which is quite important since India is getting an international hub. So, how do you see them? Do you see any challenges at the moment? Have you not started preparation yet? Or are you finding it easy to get all the flying rights which you need for international operations? Could you please help on that?",
                            'Congrats on the good results. My first question is on compensation again. So past 3 quarters has seen total cumulative compensation of Rs.2,300 crores, Rs.2,400 crores. Is this attributable cost of Rs.2,400 crores for the same 3 quarters and net spread neutral for the company as such? And maybe now the quarterly impact or compensation would be Rs.800 crores -- to the tune of Rs.800 crores going forward?'

In Q1, the Indian economy registered a robust growth of 8% which gave an indication of economic activities returning to near normal post the GST roll-out. However, the momentum gained at the start didn’t sustain during the rest of the year and the economy faced major challenges leading to a slowdown in domestic consumption in the later part of the year. The pace of global economy also slowed down and couldn’t provide meaningful support to the Indian economy. The Government and the RBI undertook a slew of measures to provide the necessary stimulus to the economy..FY'15 FY'16 FY'17 FY'18 FY'19 Source: CSO.India’s passenger vehicle market grew by 2.7% in 2018-19 against 7.9% in 2017-18. This is the lowest annual industry growth recorded in previous seven years. Among the three broad industry segments, the utility vehicles segment that accounts for about 28% of industry sales, grew by 2.1%. The other two segments, passenger cars and vans, grew by 2.0% and 13.1% respectively. The urban markets witnessed weak demand while the non-urban markets saw relatively better growth. The demand for diesel models continued its weakening trend, and its industry share declined from 40% to 36%..The Company posted a volume growth of 5.3% in passenger vehicles in the domestic market (against the industry growth of 2.7%). Including the Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV) segment, the Company’s domestic sales growth stood at 6.1%..Domestic Passenger Vehicle Industry Growth.Board’s Report Corporate Governance Report Management Discussion & Analysis Business Responsibility Report.Contrary to expectations, sales were also impacted in export markets due to country specific reasons..The year also witnessed adverse commodity prices and foreign exchange movement.",
                        'Due to weak market situation, the Company could not take adequate price increases to neutralise the increase in input costs..Higher expenditure on marketing and sales promotions did not generate proportionate volume increase as demand remained low, impacting the profit margins..However, the Company could partially off-set the impact of unfavourable factors by stepping up cost reduction measures..During the year, the business partnership between Suzuki Motor Corporation and Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC), Japan started taking shape..The Company is likely to benefit immensely from this partnership by gaining access to the new-age technologies and from the mutual supply of vehicles..The Company has always endeavoured to provide clean technology in its products. India is at a nascent stage of using clean automotive technologies and the Company aims to be a front-runner in providing clean technology to the mass market. Using hybrid technology is the first step in this direction..This partnership with TMC is helping the Company to gain access to the hybrid technology. If the Company were to develop this technology on its own, it would take considerable time and significant investments. Also, many emission and safety related regulations are coming in the near future requiring more resources..Sourcing hybrid technology from Toyota could free-up the Company resources to devote them on other priorities..Combining the global volume of Suzuki and Toyota will provide a significant scale and make technology more affordable specially for a price-sensitive market like India..This partnership is also bringing opportunity to increase sales volume of the Company’s models by selling through Toyota Kirloskar Motor India. The Company is offering Baleno, Vitara Brezza, Ciaz and Ertiga to Toyota. Automobile industry is highly capital intensive and requires lots of investments in products, technologies and facilities.',

Of this, highways sector remained one of the best performing segments with the Government expenditure rising from % 34,345.2 crore in 2014-15 to % 78,625.5 crore in 2018-19 towards development and construction of highways. Moreover, nearly 39% projects were started in FY19 under the highways sector out of over 600 infrastructure related projects which started between 2014.On the highway to growth.Road projects have been on the fast-track to execution from the second half of FY19, but may still fall short of initial Government targets.Water.As per the United Nations World Water Development Report 2019 (WWDR), nearly 2.1 billion people still do not have access to clean and readily available drinking water and that up to 4.3 billion are without access to safe sanitation. It has underlined that fulfilling the human rights to safe drinking water & sanitation for all can also significantly contribute to achievement of the broad set of goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The report found that by the year 2050, 45% of global gross domestic product and 40% of global grain production will be threatened by environmental damage and lack of water resources..As compared to the global context, scenario in India is not too different. India has 4% of the world’s water resources and a disproportionate 17% of world’s population. Water leads to cultural, social, economic development of India. More than 60% of India’s irrigated agriculture land and 85% of drinking water supplies are dependent on groundwater supply. Agriculture in India is the prime user of freshwater with a share of 80% followed by industry & domestic applications. As per United Nation, any region with annual water availability of 1700 cubic meter per person is water stressed region.',
                        'In India, about 13 states spanning around 300 districts face water stress..Foreseeing the need, Indian Government increased 2019-20 budget allocation to water and sanitation to around = 21,000 Crore including Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) & National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP). So far, as many as 30 projects in 17 packages have been identified to be awarded under the HAM scheme with total value of the projects is to the tune of = 101,115 crore..Defence Industry.The defence sector is one of the most important sector in India. It has been doubling the exports since three years and is estimated to have crossed the value of ~ 10,000 crore by March 2019. This growth in export from % 1,500 crore in FY2017 to = 10,000 in FY19 has been possible due to Government reforms which has made it easier for the private players to enter the industry. Further, since the liberalisation of FDI in the sector, there has been nearly = 4000 crore of investment in the sector. Also, since Launch of Make in India initiative in 2014, the defence ministry has undertaken a number of initiatives in order to promote indigenous defence manufacturing. This includes defence procurement process, industrial licensing, foreign direct investment, exports and innovation. Further, in the previous year, 2 new defence corridors were also set up with the aim to increasing defence production to <= 1,70,000 crore by 2025..Allocated towards defence sector in the Interim Budget 2019-20.Share of Defence Services in Interim Defence Budget 2019-20.Solar Panel Manufacturing.India has witnessed a_ substantial growth in power generation in the past few years. Out of electricity produced in Q1 2019, solar power accounted for over 11.4 BUs which reflects a growth of 34% YoY from 8.5 BUs generated in Q1 2018. During the year, about 39.2 BUs of solar power was produced, recording a growth of 52% from production in FY18.',
                        "The sector imported solar modules and cells worth nearly = 184.6 billion during 2018, a decline of 37% from = 269 billion in 2017. This decline is largely attributed to demand slowdown due to withdrawal of tax incentives and imposition of safeguard duty..During the year, the sector faced several headwinds such as imposition of safeguard duty on imported PV modules, falling tariffs and continuous fall of the Indian rupee against the US dollar. The depreciation in the Indian currency is also likely to augment the capital cost of solar power projects by 20- 25%, although its impact has been partly set off by decline in the PV module prices by about 20% since June 2018. Also, implementation of recent policy initiatives such as rise in share of renewable purchase obligation for states and waiving of inter-state transmission charges for solar projects contributes to faster capacity addition in the sector..The sector is anticipated to grow in the coming fiscal owing to capacity addition, favourable policy push and increasing demand for fossil fuel based energy. Further, the sector is also anticipated to witness a heightened technology-led growth. Technological innovation, being at the centre of.solar power development in India, is also anticipated to boost the sector with the help of several important tools such as floating solar, energy storage and flexible modules.
