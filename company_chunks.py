    'Manan Vakharia from Investor Relations team. Good Morning Sir and we will start with opening remarks and post which we will have question and answer session. Thank you and over to you Sir! Robbie Singh: Thank you so much. Hi Good Morning all. This is Robbie Singh, CFO of Adani Enterprise. I welcome you all to the earnings call to discuss Q1 FY23 results. AEL continues to create value for its shareholders as a successful incubator for the past two-and-a-half decades. This incubation model has created leaders in the respective sectors like Adani Ports, Adani Transmission, Adani Green Energy, Adani Total Gas, and Adani Wilmar and has delivered returns at a compound annual growth rate of 36% to shareholders. AEL holds a portfolio of businesses - both established and incubating - which are spread across different verticals in energy and utility, transport and logistics, direct to consumer and primary industries. Within primary industries it has established businesses of mining services and integrated resource management along with the developing vertical of metals. As our established business continue to sustain long term growth, we are making significant progress in our attractive incubation pipeline comprising of energy and utility which is Adani New Industries - it is a green hydrogen ecosystem and full service data center business AdaniConneX. In the transport and logistics we have Adani Airport Holdings and Adani Road Transport Limited businesses which will further accelerate value creation for Adani Enterprise shareholders. We are happy to inform that AEL has completed primary equity transaction of Rs.7700 Crores with Abu Dhabi based International Holding Company for 3.5% stake. This validates our strong capital management philosophy of equity funded growth and conservative leverage targets. Let me give you a quick update of our incubating businesses',
    'We are happy to inform that AEL has completed primary equity transaction of Rs.7700 Crores with Abu Dhabi based International Holding Company for 3.5% stake. This validates our strong capital management philosophy of equity funded growth and conservative leverage targets. Let me give you a quick update of our incubating businesses. In Adani New Industry portfolio as all of you would know we have announced investment of USD 50 billion over the next decade in developing green hydrogen ecosystem. This will be housed under Adani New Industry Limited. ANIL will have three business streams – (i) Manufacturing ecosystem to include module, cell, ingots, wafers and wind turbines, electrolyzers and associated ancillary equipment ecosystem. (ii) The green hydrogen generation include development of solar and wind power plants to produce green hydrogen (iii) Downstream products depending on the usage for ammonia, urea, methanol, etc. During the quarter we announced our partnership with TotalEnergies to develop the world’s largest green H2 ecosystem. TotalEnergies will acquire 25% stake in ANIL. While the Page 2 of 9 Adani Enterprises Limited August 05, 2022 transaction will follow customary approval process, it takes the company one step ahead to produce the world’s least expensive electrons which will drive our ability to produce the world’s least expensive green hydrogen. Following are some of the updates on development: Existing capacity of 1.5 GW at Mundra is increasing to 3.5 GW and this additional 2 GW will be completed by September this year. With this the overall capacity will reach to 3.5 GW. Wind turbine erection for the first 5.2 MW wind turbine has been completed and testing and certification is underway. We expect completion in the next 6 months. We have identified three trial sites for initial testing of electrolyzers and we expect the testing to commence by end of this calendar year or early next year',

We have identified three trial sites for initial testing of electrolyzers and we expect the testing to commence by end of this calendar year or early next year. From operational point of view, module sales from our manufacturing ecosystem within ANIL stood at 264 MW. EBITDA from these sales was at Rs. 42 Crores. In Adani Airport Holdings portfolio, passengers movement at the airports increased by 35% and it is now at 16.6 million which is approximately 85% of the pre-COVID numbers. Construction at Navi Mumbai International Airport has started and approximately 26% of the work is completed. In Adani Road Transport portfolio, we have signed concession agreement in May for Kagal-Satara road project of 65 KMs in Maharashtra under BOT basis. We have also received provisional COD for Bilaspur road project and construction activity is progressing well on other 8 road projects. The current road portfolio is now approximately Rs.38000 Crores of both operating and under development projects. A quick update of primary industries before I handover to my colleague Vinay. We achieved financial closure for our first metals business copper. This was led by SBI and it has been further down sold to various other banks. Financial performance of AEL for this quarter in terms of revenue number has increased 223% and now is at Rs.41066 Crores. Consolidated EBITDA increased by over 100% and is at Rs.1965 Crores with strong performance from both established and incubating businesses. Now I invite my colleague Vinay to take you through mining services and IRM business highlights. Vinay over to you! Vinay Prakash: Thanks Robbie. Good Morning to all',

Now I invite my colleague Vinay to take you through mining services and IRM business highlights. Vinay over to you! Vinay Prakash: Thanks Robbie. Good Morning to all. In fact as far as the mining services business is concerned Adani Enterprise Limited is the pioneer of MDO concept in India with an integrated business model that spans across developing mines as well as the entire upstream and downstream activities. It provides the full service range - right from seeking various approvals, land acquisition, R&R, developing required infrastructure, mining, beneficiation and transportation to designated consumption plants. The company is also MDO for nine coal blocks and two iron ore blocks with combined peak capacity of 120 MMT per annum. These 11 projects are located in the state of Chhattisgarh, MP and Odisha. The mining production volume increased by 72% to 8.1 MMT on year-on-year basis and further dispatch increased by 58% to 7.2 MMT on year-on- year basis. The revenue from mining services increased by 18% to Rs. 677 Crores and EBITDA stood at Rs. 268 Crores versus Rs. 307 Cores on year-on-year basis on account of high operating costs. As Robbie told about copper business apart from financial closure, operational activities are progressing well and it is as per schedule. Additionally, we have also received PLI scheme approval for copper tube value added scheme for our copper business. As far as the IRM business is concerned, in terms of IRM business we have continued to develop business relationship with Page 3 of 9 Adani Enterprises Limited August 05, 2022 diversified customers across various end-user industries',

We retained number one player position in India and having the endeavor to maintain this position going forward. The volume in Q1 FY23 increased by 52% to 26.7 MMT, the EBITDA has increased by 72% to Rs.950 Crores on account of higher volumes. Thank you. Moderator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question and answer session. The first question is from the line of Mohit Kumar from DAM Capital Advisors. Please go ahead. Mohit Kumar: Good Morning Sir and congratulations on achieving success in number of initiatives and especially raising money. Sir my first question is on the mining operations given that you achieved 8.1 million tonne our profitability EBITDA is not improving it has happened in Q4 also and in this quarter as well. How do you expect this EBITDA ramp up to happen, I understand that we opened around 55 million tonne of capacity when do you expect this peak capacity to achieve? Vinay Prakash: As I told last time also in PEKB mine considering that we are getting higher cost because of the diesel explosive and the stripping ratio, our EBITDA has gone down slightly and we are working on various other technology initiatives to see as how we can recover it back. In fact in this volume the volume of Talabira and other mines have also included where we have lower revenue because of having lower scope and considering the mining cost per tonne is lower and definitely the EBITDA per tonne is also lower in those mines',
    'In fact in this volume the volume of Talabira and other mines have also included where we have lower revenue because of having lower scope and considering the mining cost per tonne is lower and definitely the EBITDA per tonne is also lower in those mines. As far as the increase in volumes are concerned we are working on both the sites trying to see if we can have alternate fuels to be used apart from going for the electric equipments and some technology changes. We are confident that we will be in position to increase the EBIDTA level going further. Mohit Kumar: The new mines which are under development, which are the next mines you are likely to open in the next 24 months? Vinay Prakash: So we have few mines which should get opened in the next 24 months like Parsa is ready to get opened subject to certain local approvals we should open that mine soon. We have Suliyari mine which is now going to go for its peak capacity. We have Talabira mine which did 7 million tonne last year should do 12 million tonne this year and going forward should reach to its peak capacity which is 20 million tonne. We have other commercial mines like Dhirauli and Bijahan which should also come on board. Mohit Kumar: Understood Sir and is it possible to break up the IRM operations into Carmichael and PO trading business? Is it possible are you sharing that number, in case you are sharing please share the revenue EBITDA number for Carmichael? Vinay Prakash: I think this IRM business is independent of Carmichael business, Mr. Shah will like to comment here but this IRM is excluding Carmichael. Saurabh Shah: So this number of IRM basically is only the trading business not the Carmichael commercial mines',
    'Shah will like to comment here but this IRM is excluding Carmichael. Saurabh Shah: So this number of IRM basically is only the trading business not the Carmichael commercial mines. Page 4 of 9 Adani Enterprises Limited August 05, 2022 Mohit Kumar: Understood Sir but can you share the revenue and EBITDA of Carmichael if possible? Saurabh Shah: So just to give an idea that we have done one million metric tonnes of sales in Carmichael mines this quarter with EBITDA of about Rs. 85 Crores is what we had. Mohit Kumar: First on the LoA side the government I think we are participating in the PLI scheme and we were one of the winners of that have we received the LoA from the government? Robbie Singh: That is continuing. We are not doing this business for PLI scheme. I think we should keep the focus on the fact the Adani New Industries is setting up green hydrogen ecosystem. Now if the PLI scheme happen it would be wonderful because that is part of Atmanirbhar programme of the government and it will benefit us but independent of that, it is a specific opportunity for India to finally have an energy source that is domestic and therefore it has its own economic merits. Having said that if you can kindly frame the questions in relation to that manner it is much, much better. Mohit Kumar: Understood Sir. Of course we are doing the first ramp up of 1.5 to 3.5 megawatt. What is the next in the solar manufacturing business and what duration you think you will do the third expansion? Robbie Singh: Basically the ramp up of the business is related to what our final targets to achieve the cheapest electron for production of green hydrogen. We will have in phase one a capacity of 10 gigawatt from all the way from polysilicon to ingots, wafer and cell and module line. We will also have initial capacity of 2.5 gigawatt of wind turbines which will also scale up to 7',

We will also have initial capacity of 2.5 gigawatt of wind turbines which will also scale up to 7.5 and we will also have capacity for electrolyzers plus glass aluminum frames and back sheet, so this whole ecosystem is to provide inputs into the production of cheapest electron so that we can convert that to the cheapest hydrogen. So, the scale up will be related to how we are developing and we expect the first production of hydrogen to commence late calendar year 2025 or first quarter of calendar year of 2026 so that is the ramp up schedule that we are working towards. The polysilicon should be full 10 gigawatts to start off because that is the minimal scale of its economics. Mohit Kumar: Timeline for polysilicon any tentative timeline? Robbie Singh: 30 months around that period. Mohit Kumar: Understood Sir. Thank you and best of luck. I will go back in the queue. Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Apoorva Bahadur from Investec. Please go ahead. Apoorva Bahadur: Hi Sir. Thank you so much for the opportunity. Sir I wanted to know if we have finalized the electrolyzer technology partnership? Page 5 of 9 Adani Enterprises Limited August 05, 2022 Robbie Singh: No, we are working on that. As I mentioned we are currently in the process of starting the testing programme for electrolyzer and parallel to that we are continuing to work on partnerships. But it is a dual track process both partnerships and indigenous capacity',

As I mentioned we are currently in the process of starting the testing programme for electrolyzer and parallel to that we are continuing to work on partnerships. But it is a dual track process both partnerships and indigenous capacity. Apoorva Bahadur: So we are confident that our factory will be up and running and start producing electrolyzer so that we can start producing hydrogen by end 2025. Those timelines are comfortable? Robbie Singh: Yes. Apoorva Bahadur: Sir also on the wind capacity side, can you guide by when this 2.5 gigawatt capacity be commercial and also will we be selling the turbines to third party in the commercial market or will it entirely be for our captive consumption? Robbie Singh: Mostly initially will be for captive consumption. We have commissioned or erected the first 5.2 megawatt wind turbine; it requires a certification process. We expect the certification process to complete in the next 6 months and by that time we will ramp up the production capacity and we would be ready to produce 2.5 gigawatt. Apoorva Bahadur: Right Sir and last question from my side and that is on the power storage front. So, I believe for producing hydrogen using alkaline which we will be going for initially we require sort of longer duration power available or more reliable power so what is our take on that',
    'We expect the certification process to complete in the next 6 months and by that time we will ramp up the production capacity and we would be ready to produce 2.5 gigawatt. Apoorva Bahadur: Right Sir and last question from my side and that is on the power storage front. So, I believe for producing hydrogen using alkaline which we will be going for initially we require sort of longer duration power available or more reliable power so what is our take on that. Which technology or which method of storage will we be backing ? Will it be from hydro or battery and in either cases if you have already done some tie ups? Robbie Singh: That is the configuration we are testing so we are going through as to what and how the configuration of best operating configuration works to give the cheapest hydrogen given a power input profile and so therefore we are going to be testing the electrolyzer purely at a wind power site, purely at solar site and a hybrid wind and solar site so we will complete that parallelly to then come up with the best design configuration under which the optimal hydrogen can be produced at an optimal cost so that we are in the process of doing. Once it is done we will continue to disclose it to the market as to how we are doing, but at this stage in phase one of the analysis it does not rely on battery for storage. Apoorva Bahadur: Okay Sir last question if I may squeeze in one more and I believe we intend to move hydrogen from Khavda to Mundra using a pipeline so have we started the construction of it and what type of capital cost can we expect? Robbie Singh: The pipeline is not a big cost. Pipeline is very, very small cost of the overall project but the right of way and all that analysis is being completed and it is only about 200 KMs so it is not a very long pipeline so we expect that to be ready and complete',
    'Pipeline is very, very small cost of the overall project but the right of way and all that analysis is being completed and it is only about 200 KMs so it is not a very long pipeline so we expect that to be ready and complete. Apoorva Bahadur: No specialized material needed to transport hydrogen because that is what we have read? Robbie Singh: They are specialized but they are all available. Page 6 of 9 Adani Enterprises Limited August 05, 2022 Apoorva Bahadur: Okay fair enough Sir. Thank you very much and all the very best. Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sandip Bansal from ASK Investment Managers. Please go ahead. Sandip Bansal: Thank you Sir for the opportunity. Robbie, I wanted to understand what would be the capital requirements across our various businesses over the next few years especially on the equity side? Robbie Singh: From equity point of view for the time being we are fully funded. We did already in advance. From time-to-time we might look at appropriately funding various businesses but the bulk we completed that in May with IHC Rs.7700 Crores and overall from just pure capex perspective we expect the capex commitments over the next two years to be in the order for AEL of give or take about Rs.85000 Crores and including revenue plus EPC margin plus internal cash flows and already funded equity that is fully covered in our current planning so we do not anticipate any new equity for the already identified projects. Sandip Bansal: Sure so this Rs.85000 Crores if I understand correctly is FY2024 and 2025 or FY2023 and 2024? Robbie Singh: It is 2023 and 2024 but of this Rs.85000 approximately like about Rs.7000 Crores to Rs.8000 Crores which we have already spent on our manufacturing ecosystem it is already spent. It will just be completed this year part of it. From an outlay perspective it is completing in FY2023 just as to give break up for you so that you see that airports will be about Rs',
    'Sandip Bansal: Sure so this Rs.85000 Crores if I understand correctly is FY2024 and 2025 or FY2023 and 2024?

It will just be completed this year part of it. From an outlay perspective it is completing in FY2023 just as to give break up for you so that you see that airports will be about Rs.11000 Crores this year, roads would be around Rs.8900, we will have in the copper about Rs.2900, data center small amount Rs.300 odd Crores and in our other materials businesses around Rs.4400 Crores and that will be Rs.37000 odd Crores of which as I mentioned approximately Rs.8500 is already spent in the previous year completing this year and the following year in 2024 we expect to have another Rs.48000 Crores of capex. Sandip Bansal: Sure thanks for that. On the airport business side if you can help us understand some of your plans because now it has been a few months since we have taken over the Mumbai airport as well and Navi Mumbai construction has also started. So how should we think about the trajectory for revenues as well as EBITDA over the next few years? Robbie Singh: See the best way to explain the airport business is that we look at airports as hyperlocalized community economic assets which is that primarily the airport is an economic center for a regional area in which it is be it Jaipur, be it Ahmedabad, be it Lucknow, Navi Mumbai, Mumbai. So number one, we have a plan which we call the city side planning and the city side planning is purely catering to its local community so that is one',
    'So number one, we have a plan which we call the city side planning and the city side planning is purely catering to its local community so that is one. Second is related to passenger activity and associated activities which is related to aero and non aero income at the airports, There are three income streams, the city economic area activity and the passenger aero and non- aero activity, so we expect to complete our first phase of our city side which is non-passenger related but city side developments by first phase it should be completed by 2026 and fully completed by 2030 across our eight airport sites. Because it is so far out and those are the numbers not formally presented because of the period of which they are forecast overall the Page 7 of 9 Adani Enterprises Limited August 05, 2022 structure would work is the city side developments or local economic area should give us about 55% to 60% of our EBITDA and aero and non-aero should give us the other 40% EBIDTA of the business so I would not, till we formally start reporting on Adani Airport Holding as a business unit which we will shortly. We do not want to hazard unverified forecast for the airport business per se. This year though airports achieved just to give you a passenger movement of about 16.6 million this quarter and cargo of about 2.3 lakh metric tonnes and broadly we achieved approximately Rs.540 Crores of EBITDA that we achieved from the airport business this quarter, but this is without any income coming yet from the city side economic developments which will commence about three years from now. Sandip Bansal: Sure and just one clarification when you talk about city side development does this include the real estate monetization at the Mumbai airport as well or that is excluding that? Robbie Singh: We do not look at this as real estate monetization; there is no monetization of real estate',
    'Sandip Bansal: Sure and just one clarification when you talk about city side development does this include the real estate monetization at the Mumbai airport as well or that is excluding that? Robbie Singh: We do not look at this as real estate monetization; there is no monetization of real estate. It is actually what you are building for the local community and how the local community spends within the airport region so it is not specifically like trying to monetize the land and trying to undertake that kind of activity it is more related to what is needed in the specific local community you build facilities for that community and then you are earning income from that built capacity so it will depend from city-by-city. It is more of a consumer centric model rather than a model that is related to monetization of land, etc. Sandip Bansal: Sure Robbie Thank you so much. Moderator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Mohit Kumar from DAM Capital Advisors. Please go ahead. Mohit Kumar: Thanks for the opportunity once again Sir. Few clarifications do you have access to all the 140 acre land in Mumbai airport? Robbie Singh: Yes of course we have access to all the lands. Mohit Kumar: My question is it completely with us or it is something which is still to be transferred to us for the development you want to do on the land? Robbie Singh: Majority of it is with us. Mohit Kumar: My second question is on the profitability of the solar business. I think this quarter it was impacted adversely I believe this is primary because of the movement in polysilicon prices. How do you see over the next couple of quarters given the fact that you are going to ramp up, do you think the profitability when will go back to old level of profitability? Robbie Singh: The solar business is not the business that we look at in isolation',

Robbie Singh: The solar business is not the business that we look at in isolation. We look at is an integrated part of the green hydrogen ecosystem so there is no specific target that we want to achieve for the Page 8 of 9 Adani Enterprises Limited August 05, 2022 solar business. We want to achieve the target for green hydrogen per kg so that is the matrix that we are focused on. Mohit Kumar: But are you saying that this 2.5 gigawatt entirely will be for the captive requirements? Robbie Singh Mostly yes. Mohit Kumar: My request is to share the debt breakup which we used to do earlier business wise it used to be very helpful. Robbie Singh We still do it. It will be available in September results. It is available twice a year September and March. Mohit Kumar: Okay understood Sir. Thank you and all the best. Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Nirav Shah from GeeCee Investments. Please go ahead. Nirav Shah: Hi Sir and thanks for the opportunity. Just one question. Most of them have been answered. On the MDO front we have given guidance of around 40 million tonnes in this year and around 75 odd tonnes next year so can you just update on that whether are we maintaining it or upgrading it? Vinay Prakash: We are maintaining this 40 million tonne for this year and for the next year 65 to 75 million tonne depending upon the timing of various approvals. Nirav Shah: Okay great Sir. Thanks Sir. Moderator: Thank you. As there are no further questions I now hand the conference over to management for closing comments. Robbie Singh: Firstly thank you so much for organizing',
    'Nirav Shah: Okay great Sir. Thanks Sir. Moderator: Thank you. As there are no further questions I now hand the conference over to management for closing comments.

With this, I would like to hand over to Mr. Gopal Vittal for the opening remarks. Gopal Vittal – Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer - Bharti Airtel Limited Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining this webinar to discuss Bharti Airtel’s results for the Quarter ended 30th June 2022. Also present with me on this webinar are Soumen Ray, Harjeet Kohli and Arpan Goyal. I want to focus this quarter’s earnings call on three things. Some overall comments and an update on our performance, a deeper dive into our 5G approach now that the auction is behind us and why I believe we are so well positioned as Airtel to win the coming 5G game. Despite macro challenges, we have seen another steady quarter for Airtel. Our consolidated revenues for the Quarter grew sequentially by 4.1% to hit Rs 32,805 crores. In India our EBITDA margins improved to get to 51% We have now received the 700 million USD from Google for a stake of 1.2 percent. Our leverage at the end of the quarter stands at 2.52x and has been consistently getting better. This is due to our tight fiscal prudence and improved operating leverage that we are seeing. A quick word on ESG. To drive greater transparency around how our businesses are creating value by contributing towards a sustainable in economy, we are voluntarily making our BRSR disclosure with effect from the financial year ending March 2022. I am also delighted that Sustainalytics has upgraded the ESG rating of Airtel to Low risk with a significant enhancement in rank across all telecommunications services companies globally. During the quarter Nxtra was recognized as one of the Sustainable Organizations 2022',

During the quarter Nxtra was recognized as one of the Sustainable Organizations 2022. In order to bring world-class digital access to all and reduce the digital divide, we became the first ISP to launch broadband in Ladakh and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Finally, we continue to maintain the highest standards of corporate, financial and operational disclosure. Let me now briefly touch on each of our businesses. I will start with our smallest but most exciting businesses. Airtel Payments bank now has a monthly transacting user base of 44.4 million. This quarter we clocked an annual revenue run rate of Rs 1100 crores and a GMV of 5.4 billion Dollars. Our take rates of 0.66 percent are the highest in the industry making us the only profitable fintech player. In addition, our digital services have now reached an annualized run rate of Rs 850 crores. As I have mentioned before, our digital business is extremely capital light and leverages our underlying strengths. Now I want to turn to Airtel Business, a segment that I like to think of as a jewel in the portfolio. Here we reported strong 4.4% sequential revenue growth. We have out-performed the other listed companies in this space and accelerated our market share further. In fact, Airtel Business has reached a special milestone and is now the #1 B2B player in India. Our success can be attributed to a razor-sharp strategy of both going wide to penetrate more accounts as well as going deep to serve our largest customers with our full set of products and solutions',

You should also know that all our IoT customers are postpaid customers but we include these connections as a part of the Airtel Business segment. So at the end of Q1, we had a customer base of about 29.2 Million on Postpaid – 18.1 million reported in Mobile services as a part of our Mobile services and another 11.1 million IoT connections. In effect Post-paid, therefore, as a segment is about 45% larger than our nearest competitor. Our broadband business has continued to see very strong customer additions driven by rapid roll outs and solid marketing. During the quarter, we added 1.7 Mn home passes on the back of accelerated rollouts through the local cable operator model. With this, we are now present in 983 cities. We are making solid investments in this segment to build a pole position in the broadband market. As a result, we added 310K customers and reported 5.7% sequential revenue growth. This was despite some offset of a one-off benefit in Q4FY22. The DTH business saw a decline of 0',

This was despite some offset of a one-off benefit in Q4FY22. The DTH business saw a decline of 0.9 percent but the silver lining is that we have consistently grown market share over the last few quarters. As I have said before, the entire industry has been brought to its knees by excessive regulation. The New Tariff order introduced a few years ago created mind boggling complexity for the customer with no benefit to any stake holder. Secondly, the same content, if provided through a different medium – broadband or wireless is not subject to this tariff order creating an arbitrage and uneven playing field. Finally, good content is being made available on Free to Air channels. This perfect storm has led to serious head winds in an industry where there is still a massive opportunity to grow from Cable. Given this backdrop, our approach has been to leverage the core strengths of the ongoing broadband explosion to put Airtel Black and Convergence at the heart of our strategy. We have seen substantial growth in the last month on our broadband and content bundling that includes linear TV as well as OTT content. We expect the business therefore to see some recovery in the coming quarters. Let me now turn to the Mobile segment. Here we have seen sequential revenue growth of 3.4%. We added 4.5 million 4G net adds in the quarter and about 250K postpaid customers. With the increase in prices of entry level smart phones, and the focus of OEM’s on higher value smart phones, the overall industry did see a nearly 15 percent reduction in upgradation. We expect this to normalize over the coming quarters',

We expect this to normalize over the coming quarters. At Rs 183 ARPU, we continue to lead the industry. We are confident that we will see ARPU of Rs 200 and eventually Rs 300 arising out of tariff rises. In all, the quarter witnessed broad-based growth across all of our businesses and our focus on war on waste led to improvement in margins. Let me now turn to 5G. As you know, Airtel has now acquired 100 MHz of 3.5 Ghz across every circle in the country. 3.5 Ghz is the work horse layer for 5G and will give us a pan India foot print that can bring a true 5G experience for our customers. In addition, Airtel has acquired 800 Mhz of 26 Ghz spectrum across every circle in the country. This is a band that has limited propagation but gives 4 Gbps type speeds. Finally, we also bolstered our spectrum holdings in the mid band and low band (1800/2100/900 bands). As a result, the total commitment in this auction was 43040 crores. Let me now give you our approach on 5G. I want to do this in real layman terms so that I am hopefully able to demystify the incorrect narratives that are making the rounds in a few places. You may know there are two modes in which 5G operates. Stand Alone (or SA) mode and Non Stand Alone (or NSA mode). In the SA mode, 5G comes as a top up to an existing 4G radio layer. The 4G layer then operates independently. There are two issues here. The first is the lack of a well-developed eco system for SA devices. The second issue is propagation. The work horse layer 3.5 Ghz, has lesser propagation than even 2',
    'You may know there are two modes in which 5G operates. Stand Alone (or SA) mode and Non Stand Alone (or NSA mode). In the SA mode, 5G comes as a top up to an existing 4G radio layer. The 4G layer then operates independently. There are two issues here. The first is the lack of a well-developed eco system for SA devices. The second issue is propagation. The work horse layer 3.5 Ghz, has lesser propagation than even 2.3 Ghz and this impacts coverage in urban areas. As a result, SA can be effective only if there is a sub Ghz layer that is also offering SA and the two work in conjunction. The role of the sub Ghz layer is only for coverage not capacity or speed. So the sub Ghz is needed where 3.5 does not reach. In fact, we have seen in our trials that the sub Ghz layer on 5G SA gives only 8-10 Mbps speeds, no different from 4G. This is a very important point to understand given the misconceptions about the 700 band and why it is a panacea to everything. It is not. The band is absolutely no different from 850 or 900 in terms of propagation. All it does is provide coverage at the edge, deep indoor or in far flung rural areas. And gives at best 4G like speeds. Nothing more. The second mode that 5G operates is NSA. A word on the physics involved. The limitation of Radios and spectrum propagation is the uplink. It is the uplink that allows a user device to upload a photo, any other content or even have a conversation. The down link however can travel much further which as you can imagine, is of no help for user experience because without uplink capabilities there will be no coverage. In the NSA mode, the great advantage is that the 3.5 Ghz layer actually travels much further because it performs the down link – it does not need to do the uplink – because that is done by the 4G layer – this is invariably the 1800/2100 band, also called mid band. As a result, there are several advantages of the NSA mode. First, the 3',

As a result, there are several advantages of the NSA mode. First, the 3.5 Ghz band extends at least 30 percent more on the down link, which implies a massive 100 meters extra. This gives you substantially more coverage in urban areas, when mid band is providing the uplink. At the edge when you need further extension of coverage and the mid band does not work, the fall back in terms of coverage is provided by the sub-ghz layer. Republished with permission.

It is the most widely available eco system in the world and as you know telecom is a game of eco systems. In the US and South Korea where both SA and NSA have been launched the traffic on SA is less than 10 percent of total 5G traffic. The third advantage of this mode is that it allows us to use existing 4G technology at no extra cost since we already have the radios and the spectrum that are live on our network. Finally, the last advantage of NSA is around experience – it will allow for a faster call connect time on Voice. In addition, it allows us to provide a faster uplink than anyone else given our massive spectrum holdings in the mid band. This is what leads me to the crux of the issue. To offer NSA you need solid mid band spectrum. Because that is what provides a great uplink experience',
    'Finally, the last advantage of NSA is around experience – it will allow for a faster call connect time on Voice. In addition, it allows us to provide a faster uplink than anyone else given our massive spectrum holdings in the mid band. This is what leads me to the crux of the issue. To offer NSA you need solid mid band spectrum. Because that is what provides a great uplink experience. Over the last few years we have strategically accumulated the largest pool of mid band spectrum – today we have 30 Mhz of mid band spectrum in 4 circles and 20 or above in the rest. Our competition does not have such large mid band spectrum. Do remember that if we did not have this large chunk of precious mid band spectrum we would have had no choice but to buy expensive 700 mhz spectrum. And once we had bought it we would have had to deploy large power guzzling radios on this band. Not only would the cost have been higher, it would have led to more carbon emissions and very very importantly given us no additional coverage than our existing 900 spectrum band. So in sum, what would we have got. More cost, more ESG unfriendly and no improvement in coverage. Therefore, this well thought out strategy for spectrum acquisition through auctions, M&A and trading over the last five years has allowed us to avoid the need for adding an expensive sub Ghz band and yet deliver a world class 5G experience. In sum, our consistent long term spectrum strategy, will help us meet all our objectives - the best 5G experience, 100x capacity enhancement, the most power efficient solution and a lower total cost of ownership. We believe this will give us an enduring competitive advantage for years to come. With this auction, we are fully confident that we will not be required to spend any material amount on spectrum for many years to come. Let me now briefly touch on our 5G readiness and rollout. We intend to launch 5G starting August and extending to a Pan India roll out very soon',
    'We believe this will give us an enduring competitive advantage for years to come. With this auction, we are fully confident that we will not be required to spend any material amount on spectrum for many years to come. Let me now briefly touch on our 5G readiness and rollout. We intend to launch 5G starting August and extending to a Pan India roll out very soon. By March 2024 we believe we will be able to cover every town and key rural areas as well with 5G. In fact, detailed network rollout plans for 5000 towns in India are completely in place. This will be one of the biggest roll outs in our history. While our 3-year capex will remain around the same levels this rapid roll out could see some advancing of capex on an in year basis. Every network domain is completely 5G ready. Our transport layer has been built over the years. With the combination of fiber to the tower, synergies from fiber to the home and the availability of E-band micro wave spectrum, every site we roll out will be backhaul ready to provide 5G experience in line with what is needed to deliver a world class experience. Our multi terabit MPLS and internet backbone is fully ready to take on the 5G led data growth. Even on the cloud network side, we have best of breed partners for the cloud platform that will help us in the deployment of our network in a smooth manner. At the same time, our core and our radio network are all future proofed and can operate either on NSA or SA mode. So over time, as more and more devices come in to India and we see disproportionate 4G traffic move on to the 5G network, we will be able release all of our spectrum on 4G band – 1800/2100/900 and even 2300 to SA and switch seamlessly from one mode to the other – all of this at the flick of a button through software. I now want to step back and share my confidence by giving you five powerful reasons on why we will win the 5G game. First, our whole business is squarely focused on quality customers',
    'I now want to step back and share my confidence by giving you five powerful reasons on why we will win the 5G game. First, our whole business is squarely focused on quality customers. Whether it is Mobile, Broadband or Converged products everything we do across channels, marketing or differentiation is singularly centered on Quality customers. We see the lowest level of churn amongst these customers and they will be the ones who will upgrade to a 5G device faster than anyone else. Second, we have one of the most powerful Enterprise Businesses where we have the relationships and enjoy the trust of our customers. This business has incredible momentum. All of 5G enterprise innovation will be brought to the market by us to serve these customers. I believe we can win even more strongly on 5G because of the Enterprise business. Third, we have compelling digital capabilities now to lead the 5G game. Whether it is our omni channel approach or indeed our digitization of the network, we are now ahead. A couple of examples here. We now have our own Airtel Self Optimising network, built by our Engineers. This is an AI-ML driven in-house, closed loop, self-healing platform. It was developed for automated network management, for proactively managing faults, for saving power on the fly and much else. Use cases are being written every fortnight. This powerful tool has won global awards as well. A second tool has been built to completely automate 5G network planning, configuration, on boarding and even for field operations. Our Security operating centre (SOC) for enhanced security and vulnerability management is also 5G ready. These capabilities will allow us to deliver the best 5G experience.

So whether it is our Payments bank, our Wynk music platform, our X stream video platform, our launch of Airtel IQ or even Airtel Ads each of these also creates stickiness. And this stickiness translates to lower churn and higher switching cost. Finally, the most important reason - our track record. We came into the market late on 4G in 2016 against a deep pocketed competitor that rolled out a larger and wider network than Airtel who was in the industry for many years. It had not happened anywhere else in the world. While that was happening, narratives were spun. A pure 4G network is so much better than a legacy network. Simple and clean 4G is so much better than multi technology networks. We have heard such illogical and fact free stories before. All I can point you to is our track record. We have the best quality customer in the industry. We deliver the best experience in the industry. We are constantly getting better every day. Our whole purpose is to serve our customers. We listen to them carefully. And the icing on the cake is that we have out- performed the industry by notching up consistent market share gains for many years. In my view the only thing that customers really care about is Experience',

Because we have been very astute in our spectrum acquisition. Because we will continue to invest in the best technology. We will work with the best global partners. We will not try and do everything ourselves because we are not arrogant to even entertain a fleeting feeling that we can be better than our partners. These are the reasons for my confidence. And for you the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. With this let me open up the floor for Q&A. Rajyita - Moderator Thank you very much Sir.

Sanjesh Jain - ICICI Securities Good afternoon, Gopal. Thanks for that elaborated understanding on 5G, that is really really useful. Few questions from 5G, first on the capex, you did mention that your three year capex holistically will not change, so we assume that for three years we still are confident that we will be spending only Rs 75,000 Crores or Rs 750 billion, which we were anticipating earlier, that remains true? How much of it will be front loading because we are also very, very aggressively pushing 5G, now talking of reaching 5000 towns by the end of March 2024, that looks like an impressive plan, but how much will it consume in terms of cash flow in the near term say for the next two years, how should we look at? That is number one. Number two on the operating costs you did mention on the user experience and the capex side of SA and NSA, can you elaborate what will be the difference between the operating costs in SA and NSA now considering that NSA will also sweat the 5G asset while SA will be predominantly a standalone 5G stack. Will it have any material difference from the operating cost side of it? Third one, on the economics of 5G itself, now that we have got a such a large spectrum pool and now we are also rolling out additional network on it, how should one think on this incremental investment? What will be the IRR? How will an operator recover the investment? So these are my initial questions. Thanks. Gopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer - Bharti Airtel Limited Thanks, Sanjesh',

Gopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer - Bharti Airtel Limited Thanks, Sanjesh. I think on the capex we do not give guidance anymore, but if you look at our capex profile over the last couple of years, we expect if you take a three years type of view we will probably be in the same ballpark. Of course, we will advance the capex in this year itself, starting now. So to that extent there will be advancement of capex that will happen over the course of this year and I think in an 18 months period it will normalize. On the operating costs, I think if we did not have the mid band spectrum and we had to buy the 700 Mhz band, we would need to spend let us say for 10 megahertz of spectrum Rs 40,000 Crores. This would need more antennas, big radios, extra radios across the country in all the sites that we go in, extra power that will need to be deployed there and extra rentals of the radios. All this would have had a cost per GB disadvantage compared to where we are today of almost 50%. So, if we are at X today, we would be 50% higher cost per GB. That is our math which is the reason that over the last five years we have carefully acquired a large pool of mid band spectrum because it was very, very well thought through. We never went public about it because obviously it was highly Republished with permission.

This was really the strategy for us to make sure that we get to 20-30 megahertz in all circles in mid band and that is really what we have done. The economics of 5G is a function of I would say the incremental tariff increases that industry sees. Remember over the period of time, 4G capex would be displaced with 5G, as bulk of the 4G rollout has happened. Today, already 8% to 9% of the devices are 5G ready. Shipments that are coming in are about 30% to 35% of devices and we expect this will change a lot. So by next year, almost 80% to 90% of the devices that will come in will be 5G devices. Which means if you project 8% to 9% to March 2023, it could be close to 13% to 14% and then by March 2024, it will be much higher. So a bulk of our rollouts are done, which means that the capex that goes onto the radio on 4G will get displaced by 5G and this is why I stated over a three year period our capex profile fundamentally stays the same. How the pricing will work between 5G and 4G is something that have not yet quite decided, so I am not going to comment on that right now',

What we have seeing globally is that 5G by itself is not yet giving incremental ARPU to any operator anywhere in the world, but in India as you know tariffs are still very low, we do expect tariffs to increase and with every increase in tariffs obviously the economics will change and the return on capital will get much-much better. Sanjesh Jain - ICICI Securities That is quite clear. Just one last question before come back in the queue. You have formed customer advisory board for your enterprise business, now what are they telling about the 5G adoption in India particularly for Airtel, what are their demand and is 5G capex is in sync with them, are they really excited about the 5G or they think it is too much for them to invest initially to justify their ROCE, what is their understanding on enterprise side of 5G? Gopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer - Bharti Airtel Limited On the enterprise side of 5G, the customer advisory board has given us a lot of ideas on new services to be launched. Airtel IQ, work from anywhere solution, a lot of the work that we have done on the SD-WAN and the startup acquisitions came out of these discussions. We are also having multiple conversations on private networks with a large number of companies. So we are looking at that. As of now, our rollout will happen over a period of time, we will see how the enterprise use cases play out. But there are ongoing conversations on standalone networks for large distributed enterprises',

Sanjesh Jain - ICICI Securities So, we see in FY2024 some contribution in enterprise coming from the 5G part of it or will it an ambitious one? Gopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer - Bharti Airtel Limited No, I think that the enterprise contribution has been going up in the overall profile of the company. The enterprise business has performed exceedingly well over the last decade. We see no reason why the enterprise business will not sustain its growth. Obviously as new technologies come, we also see adoption. So to that extent, I do not look at isolating what in the enterprises is coming out of 5G. I look at 5G, 4G and all of this as underlying connectivity layers, but it is also giving you the capability of adding new solutions. Ultimately, we are going to deliver solution for the customers which will lead to revenue, so whichever technology comes from is not the issue, the issue is how we are going to grow the enterprises business. Sanjesh Jain - ICICI Securities Got it, Gopal. Thanks for all the answers and will come back in the queue for others. Rajyita – Moderator Thank you, Thank you very much Mr. Jain.

Pranav Kshatriya - Edelweiss Securities Thanks for the opportunity. My first question is on this NSA and SA, if you look at this SA rollout has been very recent and to that extent as you rightly pointed the ecosystem is not mature, but do you think that at some point if the SA becomes more predominant and the ecosystem picks up, we have the flexibility to really acquire additional spectrum and make the network SA. That is my first question. Secondly, there has been a fairly strong acceleration in terms of number of cities where you are present in terms of the fiber for home broadband, so can we expect that to drive disproportionate growth in the coming quarters and lastly a bookkeeping Republished with permission.

Thank you. Gopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer - Bharti Airtel Limited I already explained the SA versus NSA issue and let me just kind of repeat this probably for the question that you asked. Over a period of time, as more and more 5G devices come in, all the 4G traffic will shift on to the 5G networks',
    'Gopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer - Bharti Airtel Limited I already explained the SA versus NSA issue and let me just kind of repeat this probably for the question that you asked. Over a period of time, as more and more 5G devices come in, all the 4G traffic will shift on to the 5G networks. Spectrum that we have in the mid band in the 1800 and 2100 band, which is 20 to 30 megahertz per circle, will be the first band that will be refarmed for 5G, 2300 band will also get refarmed for 5G, ultimately even the sub-ghz band. Remember Sub-ghz only gives you a coverage, nothing more than coverage. If it is 10 megahertz sub-ghz, it is about 7 to 8 Mbps and 5 to 6 megahertz spectrum will give 3 to 4 Mbps. So all it does is give you coverage at 4G like speeds. Thus, will be the last band to get refarmed to 5G. As the refarming happens the NSA mode can seamlessly switch on to SA. Everything is ready - the core will be ready, the radios are ready, they are all software enabled, so it is the mode of operating and in a way, there is absolutely no difference in what we will ultimately deliver in terms of customer experience. On fiber broadband, we are seeing a sharp growth. We have added 310,000 users this quarter and we see that this growth will hopefully sustain. The demand for home broadband is exploding, coupled with convergence and proposition that we launched in Airtel Black where we are combining the content bundles in both OTT and linear. We expect this to continue to see a significant traction and hopefully this business, which is a very good business with very low levels of churn, will become very sizable business in years to come. I will leave the last question to Soumen',

I will leave the last question to Soumen. Soumen Ray - Chief Financial Officer, India & South Asia - Bharti Airtel Limited Pranav, depreciation has gone up by about couple of percentage points of which there is a day extra in this quarter plus the number of towers increased with some renewals that happened, but nothing out of the ordinary. Pranav Kshatriya - Edelweiss Securities I just wanted to understand because you had this renewal, which you have had sort of one-off impact because the duration increases and that disproportionately increases the depreciation for those lease liabilities. So if you break it off, I think it will be useful? Soumen Ray - Chief Financial Officer, India & South Asia - Bharti Airtel Limited So, essentially the impact is more on interest because as you know in an equated monthly installment, in initial period the principal amount is much lesser and the interest amount is much more. So the impact is initially much more on interest and less on depreciation, but overall depreciation is up by above 2% point, 1% point is because of number of days and the other is just routine.

Mr. Vora you may please un- mute yourself, introduce yourself and ask your question now. Kunal Vora - BNP Paribas Thanks for the opportunity. This is Kunal Vora from BNP Paribas. Question is on home broadband opportunity. Can you talk about the fixed wireless broadband opportunity in India? What is the potential size of the overall home broadband market and whether we can expect fixed wireless broadband to reduce the size of FTTH opportunity? Also, home broadband this quarter looks a little soft I understand like you mentioned about from high base from last quarter, but have you seen any issues there with the economy opening up and the customers down trading with reducing work from home? Gopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer - Bharti Airtel Limited On home broadband, we have been adding about 300,000 plus customers every quarter, so we are sustaining that trajectory. If you are commenting on the sequential revenue growth, then yes. As the base inflates, we start to see some, not softening, but just the Republished with permission.

Like I said that I have confidence that this trajectory will get sustained. I think fixed wireless is an interesting opportunity and has been deployed in some markets in US and even Germany, but one of the things that we are seeing on fixed wireless is ultimately the cost per home pass',
    'Like I said that I have confidence that this trajectory will get sustained. I think fixed wireless is an interesting opportunity and has been deployed in some markets in US and even Germany, but one of the things that we are seeing on fixed wireless is ultimately the cost per home pass. It has to work competitively versus fibre in terms of cost per home pass. In India, if you look at our cost per home pass we have been able to bring it down substantially. In the cities where we roll ourselves, the cost per home pass is down to about $30 to $35. In the LCO cities it is the fraction of that cost, so on a blended basis it is substantially lower than $30. Now, typically if you rollout 100 home passes, we see the end of 18 to 24 months about 30% utilization, which means that if you are taking your blended cost let us say $15 to $18 then this is about $50 cost per home connected home. The cost of the router for fixed wireless today is about $200. In the case of Verizon in the US or DT, the cost for home pass remains almost $400, so for them the fixed wireless actually makes a lot of sense as you can put a router and spend that money. As the scale India develops, we will need to see the cost per router for the fixed wireless actually crash below $50 then it will start making some sense, but until such time that happens, our objective will be to really go very, very aggressive on fibre rollout itself as there is no better substitute for home broadband when compared to fiber. Fiber is always going to be better than wireless because it is a dedicated pipeline that you are delivering to the home and you have a full control over both the uplinks as well as the downlink with no constraints on traffic or population in that particular area. So I think it is down to economics the way we see. Kunal Vora - BNP Paribas Understood',

So I think it is down to economics the way we see. Kunal Vora - BNP Paribas Understood. The second question on the SG&A cost, we have seen a fairly sizable increase around 24 bps, we are almost 50% over the last two years and the churn has remained elevated over the last few quarters, it went to like 2% levels, but back to 3%, can you talk about like what is happening on the competitive intensity and when would you expect this to moderate? Gopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer - Bharti Airtel Limited Maybe, Soumen you can cover this. Soumen Ray - Chief Financial Officer, India & South Asia - Bharti Airtel Limited So the SG&A increase is in line with growth in business and the competitive activities in the market. Also there is a bit of deferment impact in this. It is not very different as now with the deferment, the cycle is getting caught up. But if you look at purely sales & marketing expenses, it has remained almost flat. If you are looking at other expenses inclusive then, there is the increase of about Rs 400 Crores, which is essentially around three items, the first being there is this FLO liability recasting which has been about Rs 200 Crores and then Africa there has been an increase of over Rs 150 Crores. Intrinsic India business there has been marginal increase of about 50 Crores. Kunal Vora - BNP Paribas Just one last question, if I look at the growth differential between Airtel and the number three players we are seeing some narrowing of the gap',
    'Intrinsic India business there has been marginal increase of about 50 Crores. Kunal Vora - BNP Paribas Just one last question, if I look at the growth differential between Airtel and the number three players we are seeing some narrowing of the gap. Airtel used to grow much faster compared to the number three player, we have seen that narrow despite larger investments in network can you share your thoughts on why did not happening and this larger 5G investment would we expect accelerated market will gain from the number three player? Gopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer - Bharti Airtel Limited I think that I do not want to comment on the number three player. I do believe that any operator that actually goes out and rolls a 5G network, you will start seeing the best quality customers first move to those networks and we are very confident that our postpaid business, our converged strategy, high value prepaid, all of this should see a substantial growth even with the rollout of 5G. Kunal Vora - BNP Paribas Thats it from my side. Thank you very much. Rajyita – Moderator Thank you very much Mr. Vora. The next question comes from Mr. Manish Adukia from Goldman Sachs.

Couple of questions, first one is these circles where you have some administrative spectrum coming up for renewal in 2024, like UP-East, West Bengal, and others, do you envisage spending meaningful amounts of money in the next three years in subsequent spectrum auctions? That is question number one. Question number two is on the B2B growth acceleration, so Gopal, if you could just touch up on these factors that are responsible for the faster growth, I am referring to the year-on-year growth which has been on an upward trajectory and this is not just the current quarter obviously we have seen this play out in the last several quarters, so perhaps if you could help us understand whether it is because of the market growth itself, market share gains and if you can just give us a break for colour or an update on the digital products and the new products that you launched in the B2B side and there the revenue contribution is coming from those areas? Thank you. Gopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer - Bharti Airtel Limited As I mentioned that we believe that there is very-very little amount of spectrum spend that will happen over the next few years. There are a few circles they are very small the number of circles now. It is only the ones that are coming up for renewal in 2024, which still have some admin spectrum but we have already bolstered through a substantial amount of spectrum even in the low band',
    'Gopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer - Bharti Airtel Limited As I mentioned that we believe that there is very-very little amount of spectrum spend that will happen over the next few years. There are a few circles they are very small the number of circles now. It is only the ones that are coming up for renewal in 2024, which still have some admin spectrum but we have already bolstered through a substantial amount of spectrum even in the low band. Like for example if you take Odisha, we bought liberalized spectrum even though we have admin spectrum, we did the same in West Bengal, we have done the same in UP East where 6.2 megahertz of 900Mhz will come up for renewal but we already have five megahertz of liberalized spectrum that we bought. So we have tried to bolster our holdings the same thing we did in North East & Assam so I am quite relaxed actually about the renewals component. In some cases in some places wherever there is some traffic or requirement or so on, we may bolster it but it is not essential since we are sort of running it on existing liberalized spectrum already. B2B has been a carefully crafted strategy as far as we are concerned and let me kind of comment in two parts. Number one is that we have really retooled our entire go to market on B2B, you know I mentioned before that 80% of our revenues come from 20% of our accounts. These are the most important accounts for us but I see as a glass half full so the 80% of revenue that comes from 20% of accounts we are working with them through the Customer Advisory Board to bring more solutions, more services, this is where you know Airtel IQ - the CPaaS part of it, Cybersecurity which is Airtel Secure, SD-WAN and so on and so forth are all coming in to actually create a greater share of wallet. We have seen some fabulous stories where we have been able to raise our average revenue per account quite substantially through a concerted effort',
    'We have seen some fabulous stories where we have been able to raise our average revenue per account quite substantially through a concerted effort. The second part that we have is the 20% of revenue which comes from 80% of accounts. This is where we have again retooled our GTM to really have a bunch of people looking at hunting for these accounts and this is now true for the large enterprises as well as the top end of the medium enterprises and I will come to that in a moment. So I think that part we are tracking very closely, how many accounts have we added, what is the average revenue per account for each account. So that is the second part of our strategy. The third part is really around the SME side, where we spend a lot of money and time to build a digital marketing tool to create leads, so we are now getting almost 30% to 35% of leads coming from online and digital. These leads go to actually drive the SME growth which is the third part of our approach. The fourth part of our approach is that we have in source or we have done away with the channel. The SME business used to be run by the channel and the channel would get commissioned. We have now done away with the channel and we have about 1200 people who we were brought into our own company who are responsible for the SME. The entire go-to-market architecture is something that has been a very important reason for our growth and while we have done this we have taken out one layer in the organization so that the people who are serving customers are closer to the leadership. The second part on B2B is really to develop more and more solutions and services and this is where we have spent a substantial amount of our time through building our own services as well as through partnering. Taking small bets and acquiring a few companies to create a stronger portfolio of services which can also build our B2B business. Airtel IQ is one, Airtel Secure is another',

Taking small bets and acquiring a few companies to create a stronger portfolio of services which can also build our B2B business. Airtel IQ is one, Airtel Secure is another. Airtel IQ has been building strong traction, our CPaaS business is looking very strong. So, it is the whole combination of all of this on the B2B side. Vivekanand Subbaraman - Ambit Capital Very helpful. Just one small followup as far as capex and spectrums purchases are concerned, we have not called the second call of rights issue despite participation in the 5G auction, so I am just trying to understand what are the instances in the next 12 to 24 months where you call and what would that be used for now? Harjeet Kohli - Joint Managing Director, Bharti Enterprises Vivek, this is Harjeet. I think the rights issue about Rs 15,000+ Crores of residual calls are pending and really in the coming few months, we need to evaluate basis the business cash flow profile, which by the way now is organically both significantly positive in India and Africa, at what point in time should we call for it. Gopal also mentioned the ongoing dynamic play of some bit of acceleration of capex, so we will stay agile to what this business cash flow profile is and accordingly take it all in the few months on the residual calls for rights.

Rajyita – Moderator Thank you very much Mr. Subbaraman. The next question comes from Mr. Abhiram Iyer from Deutsche Bank. Mr. Iyer you may please un-mute yourself, introduce yourself and ask your question now. Abhiram Iyer - Deutsche Bank This is Abhiram Iyer from Deutsche Bank. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on a good set of results. My query was pertaining to you mentioned that you are going to bring forward some of the capex cycle over the next three years to maybe in the next 12 to 24 months due to the rollout of 5G may I know whether this would change your debt profile and you know your leverage targets? Do you expect to end the year maybe you know sitting at a higher leverage than what it is currently or and the other thing is obviously there is significant amount of operational cash flow available to the company given the nature and the quantum of capex that might be required, do you envisage coming to the debt markets? Gopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer - Bharti Airtel Limited No. Firstly let me just kind of say that you know the operating cash flows of the business are strong enough for us to fund any requirement of capex whatever it is whatever advancing we need to do. Yes, the debt on paper will get larger because of this large spectrum payment that will be due to the government. But the way we look at spectrum payments is that this is the annual payment which is over 20 years so it is no different from an operating cost and ultimately all of the spectrum sort of translates to revenue',
    'Yes, the debt on paper will get larger because of this large spectrum payment that will be due to the government. But the way we look at spectrum payments is that this is the annual payment which is over 20 years so it is no different from an operating cost and ultimately all of the spectrum sort of translates to revenue. So if you were to take that operating cost of the repayments that are due out of the Rs 43,000 Crores, Rs 3,600 Crores is really to be paid every year and the 43000 Crores does not go into debt and you pull the EBITDA down by Rs 3,600 Crores, we serve out of the existing EBITDA pool then the debt profile is actually getting very, very healthy given the operating cash flows so the leverage position is getting better and better every year and has been so over the last couple of years. Abhiram Iyer - Deutsche Bank Got it and just a follow up question more in terms of bookkeeping, but given the fact that we have called some of foreign exchange bonds. Is this going to be some sort of strategy going forward given that you know the FX rate has not been favorable for Indian companies, do we see you looking more to call some of their foreign debt and try and get more onshore debt? Harjeet Kohli - Joint Managing Director, Bharti Enterprises If you want me, Gopal, I will just quickly pitch in and just linking back Abhiram to what Gopal mentioned in the last question, if you see the EBITDA less capex, at least till now keeping aside some bit of acceleration, globally we will have about five billion dollars of operating free cash flow and our interest costs are well within two billion dollars. Considering, that the taxes are still you know fairly minimal, so we have significant free cash flow profile that allows us to keep the leverage reasonably well in check and also reducing fundamentally',
    'Considering, that the taxes are still you know fairly minimal, so we have significant free cash flow profile that allows us to keep the leverage reasonably well in check and also reducing fundamentally. Within that leverage, our FX leverage is significantly low as you can clearly see bulk of the Indian debt is DoT liabilities, the past AGR liabilities, there is a significant amount of FLO liabilities and only a smaller amount is really external debt of which a much smaller amount in FX. So in general the FX is fairly well managed in terms of the percentage of the outstanding that are in foreign exchange. The foreign exchange bonds that we have been calling off a) till date have been in Africa which I think is very welcome. There are two three reasons; one of course Africa is creating the cash flow profiles that are able to keep calling the bonds back. Second as Africa is a listed company, it stands on its own increasingly the guaranteed bonds from Airtel India are going down. If you would go back about three four years ago you know maybe prior to listing of Airtel Africa we had more than 11 to 12 billion dollars of guarantees given from Airtel India for the bonds of five to six billion dollars that were outstanding in Airtel Africa. Now that has gone down significantly. So that is another reason why that buyback is important. Third is we have to time the interest rate situations in the market which essentially means when the bonds can be bought back at a reasonable economic savings for the company is I think the right time. So we would we would not go just to reduce the FX leverage, I think the economics of the situation, the refinance cost and including the cash flow generations from both the engines - Africa and India will govern the further buyback actions. But in general, the company maintains capital markets access and we at least in the rupee market have been fairly active and if required will be active in the dollar markets too.

Rajyita – Moderator Thank you very much Mr. Iyer. The next question comes from Mr. Aliasgar Shakir from Motilal Oswal. Mr. Shakir you may please un-mute yourself, introduce yourself and ask your question now. Aliasgar Shakir - Motilal Oswal Thanks for the opportunity. This is Aliasgar from Motilal Oswal. A couple of questions, Gopal, first one the 5G, so you did mention that the ecosystem is yet to develop on the handset device side you know we would probably in the next couple of years still be somewhere about mid teens kind of penetration levels. Just trying to understand what is the need to accelerate a 5G rollout, I mean is it to do with you know kind of matching competition or you think that you know I mean with our experience in 4G we do not want to kind of you know stay behind the curve or do you think that you know there is some possibility of better monetization opportunity left',
    'Just trying to understand what is the need to accelerate a 5G rollout, I mean is it to do with you know kind of matching competition or you think that you know I mean with our experience in 4G we do not want to kind of you know stay behind the curve or do you think that you know there is some possibility of better monetization opportunity left. So I am just trying to think about you know, why cannot we kind of wait for sometime, let the ecosystem develop and then kind of accelerate, we have already demonstrated that in our you know 4G rollout where we did accelerate it quite significantly well? Second question is you mentioned that we have not thought about how we will monetize 5G but it has been six months since the last tariff hike. Now that we plan to do 5000 town 5G rollout, how should we think of tariff hikes. Should it be direct tariff hikes or we should we see change in the plans from these unlimited plans that we have to more kind of limited plans or 5G related kind of pricing? Those are my two questions. Gopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer - Bharti Airtel Limited On the tariff front, as I have said that tariffs need to go up. When they will go up I cannot comment on right now. Secondly, to change the construct of price plans in industry for us on a unilateral basis is always a challenge competitively. We have to be competitive in the market, ultimately in this business if you grow market share you are in actually a much better long-term position for investors as well as for customers and employees. So to that extent, we will do the right thing to remain competitive. I think we have debated this. We can evaluate this a lot, we can sort of wait for the ecosystem but ultimately it is just putting the same capex that anyway would have gone. Nothing is getting wasted. It is just putting it there a little ahead of time so that we are present where we need to be',
    "So to that extent, we will do the right thing to remain competitive. I think we have debated this. We can evaluate this a lot, we can sort of wait for the ecosystem but ultimately it is just putting the same capex that anyway would have gone. Nothing is getting wasted. It is just putting it there a little ahead of time so that we are present where we need to be. Of course, having said that there is a lot of analysis that happens on where we should go and which sites we should go to and all that based on devices. All of that is happening but we did see, for example, in some of the C-category circles when we were a little late on 4G, we lost a little bit of share early on and then we have now recovered that market share over a period of time. But in the cities and A-category towns where we launched head-to-head with our competition, we had a much better outcome. So I would say that it is just a question of bringing forward capex without trying to finesse this too much and intellectualize this too much. I think that's the way we see it. You are right, if this market was uncompetitive and it was a benign kind of market with very little competitive intensity, we may have said we can even buy the spectrum next year because there is nothing going away. So to that extent the fact is that we believe that we need to be leading the narrative in terms of what we do with our customers, make sure that our best quality customers not just stay with us but we are able to attract good quality customers onto our portfolio. I think that is really what we are trying to do. Aliasgar Shakir - Motilal Oswal Understood, this is very helpful. Thank you. Rajyita – Moderator Thank you very much Mr. Shakir. Due to time constraints, I would now hand over the proceedings to Mr. Gopal Vittal for closing remarks.

    'We see opportunities in the marketplace in the current environment supported by dynamic fiscal and monetary policy. Activity indicators released during April to June quarter indicates that economic activity continues to hold up well despite global risk. GST collections, manufacturing PMI, IIP, credit, rail freight, services PMI, etc., etc., show robust opportunities in the economy. The RBI raised the policy rate by 90 basis points in the quarter taking the repo rate to 4.9. The Monetary Policy Committee also voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation in a calibrated fashion to ensure inflation remains within the RBI’s upper bank while supporting growth. Accordingly, we have responded with appropriate lending rate increases. Now let us talk about the five themes at a high level now. On the distribution expansion that is the first thing, we added 36 branches during the quarter and 250 more are in various stages of readiness to be rolled out. We have 15,618 business correspondences, an increase of 277 over prior quarter. Gold loans are now processed at just over 2000 branches as against 1340 branches in the prior quarter. It is well on the way to be a Page 2 of 22 July 16, 2022 product offering in most of our branches. Payment acceptance points have grown to 3.2 million a year-on-year growth of 42%. Wealth management is now offered in 357 locations through hub and spoke model, we have expanded to 141 new locations in the quarter. This is in accordance with our plan to take this to deeper geographies in over 900 locations in the current financial year. In commercial and global banking, SME is now offered in 640 districts in our drive to expand the SME market share. Next, let us talk about a few comments on the customer franchise building.

Trading and mark-to-market losses were 1312 Crores primarily owing to spike in benchmark bond yields witnessed during the quarter. The mark-to-market losses come from our AFS, HFC and Government of India securities, corporate bonds, and pass-through certificates. Prior quarter was a negative 40% and prior year was a gain of 600 Crores. Other miscellaneous income of 1080 Crores includes recoveries from written of accounts and dividends from subsidiaries excluding trading on mark-to- market losses total other income at 7700 Crores grew by 35% over prior year',

Our pre-provision operating profit was at 15368. Coming to asset quality, the GNPA ratio was at 1.2% as compared to 1.4% prior year. Out of the 1.28%, about 18 basis points of standard thus the core GNPA ratio is 1.1. However, these are included by us in NPA as one of the other facilities of the borrower as a NPA, but we will talk about 1.28 we will have to anchor with that. As you have seen in the past several years, agricultural segment has a seasonal impact in June and December cycle. GNPA ratio excluding NPAs in agriculture segment and a one off was at 1.03%; prior year was at 1.26% and prior quarter was at 1.01%.

Moderator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from the line of Mahrukh Adajania from Edelweiss. Please go ahead. Mahrukh Adajania: Hello Sir, my first question is on your CRB loans of course the Q-o-Q growth excluding agri has been good at 4% however we have been talking about doubling the booking in three years. So that would probably require a higher run rate of growth. So how do you see the outlook panning out for growth in CRB and also if you could throw some color on you said that you probably gave up some corporate loan growth in the commentary. So what was that about, that is my first question then I have two more. Srinivasan V: First let us talk about the CRB loans that you talked about',
    'So that would probably require a higher run rate of growth. So how do you see the outlook panning out for growth in CRB and also if you could throw some color on you said that you probably gave up some corporate loan growth in the commentary. So what was that about, that is my first question then I have two more. Srinivasan V: First let us talk about the CRB loans that you talked about. This year the loans had a robust growth of about 28%, 29% year-on-year in the quarter and we do have aggressive plans across various segments in CRB both on the MSME side as well as well as on the agri side on both sides where we have a significant growth. This growth I think we talked about it maybe a month ago in another forum that growth is predicated on one geographic expansion, we want to be present in more districts in the country to be able to capture the supply chain and the distribution chain flows. That is part of what we are trying to do to be present everywhere so that we capture all of Page 8 of 22 July 16, 2022 the chain, distribution chain, supply chain not just a part of it that we work with various other wholesale clients we are able to capture in wholesome not part. So that is part of what we are doing. The second aspect of that is also in terms of agri again its distribution expansion moving from about 1 lakh villages that we do today as a step we want to go through close to 2 lakh villages that is again part of how we want to operate and get to. There are enough opportunities we see that they are good and that can come only by where we put our salespeople, we put our relationship people in the local place where the customer is, that is part of the distribution',
    'The second aspect of that is also in terms of agri again its distribution expansion moving from about 1 lakh villages that we do today as a step we want to go through close to 2 lakh villages that is again part of how we want to operate and get to. There are enough opportunities we see that they are good and that can come only by where we put our salespeople, we put our relationship people in the local place where the customer is, that is part of the distribution. The second thing is the relationship management, which is in-addition to having a physical, we also want to have our relationship now because most of the CRB is about relationship management and we are expanding more, adding more people into that, so that we could get the right kind of a relationship to have that both from acquiring customers as well as broad basing the products that we could deliver to them, yes we are confident that segment is poised for growth and again we are not talking about it in an isolation, this is going to ride on the country’s macro growth that means we need the tailwind of the country growth also to be going up and with the MSME being almost a third of the GDP participation that is where we tend to we are focused on doing that and from a market penetration point of view again I think we told you how that growth is going to come from last time somewhere we talked which is we have only about 20% to 25% penetrated in the banking system itself. So the rest of them are outside of the banking system, they need to move in here and this is part of our both physical as well as the RM expansion strategy is to capture them and bring them into the banking system. On the wholesale loans bit something which I did not get what was the question on the wholesale. Mahrukh Adajania: No you said that 40 to 50 is or maybe I heard it wrong you said 40000 to 50000 Crores was given up because of competitive rates or something like that',

Mahrukh Adajania: No you said that 40 to 50 is or maybe I heard it wrong you said 40000 to 50000 Crores was given up because of competitive rates or something like that. Srinivasan V: Good point, yes, I did mentioned that and I specifically mentioned that I know that you will pick it up and ask, which is see there was a rate dislocation in the quarter sometime around starting May the rate started to move up there was a rate dislocation immediately after our bank and so also others started to move up on the rates and we did that and as we move up on the rate, there were some customers who were offered lower Page 9 of 22 July 16, 2022 rates by certain other market participants and we do not want to cut back on our rates to keep them. We said that is fine because we do have a relationship, we do continue to have relationship with those customers with 40000, 50000 payment and that we continue to have except that we did not endeavor by price to keep increasing those shares. So we said that is fine to let go, let somebody else can take it at a lower price than where we do and that is what I alluded to. Mahrukh Adajania: And Sir was that PSU banks or private bank. Srinivasan V: It is broadly across everywhere so like not going to the details, but it is across the banks. Mahrukh Adajania: And can you please quantify the slippage figure as in the absolute amount if you can. Srinivasan V: I think I gave the 7200 or something I did mentioned that is the 50 basis points or 0.5%. Mahrukh Adajania: And how much of that would be from restructured',
    'Mahrukh Adajania: And Sir was that PSU banks or private bank. Srinivasan V: It is broadly across everywhere so like not going to the details, but it is across the banks.

Srinivasan V: I think I gave the 7200 or something I did mentioned that is the 50 basis points or 0.5%. Mahrukh Adajania: And how much of that would be from restructured. Srinivasan V: I did not give that, but I think I alluded to that the slippage amount has got it agri and at wholesale one off which contributed almost to little more than 10 basis points so net of that it was 0.4 of 38 basis points I alluded to, the some of them not the agri piece but the other piece is the part of the restructuring. Mahrukh Adajania: Sir and my last question is on this merger dispensation. So we did see a press release on RBI approving the merger and it said terms and conditions. So were there any dispensations and if not when would one hear about dispensations applied for and also any clarity on HDFC Life stake. Srinivasan V: Two things last one is about the conditions of the dispensation. The no objection from RBI is on our application and that the conditions I think we mentioned somewhere these conditions are for example I will give you some nature of some of those things how you can think about, when the merger happens the banking regulation shall apply across all the portfolios and all the business lines. So that is part of both that the kind of giving you Page 10 of 22 July 16, 2022 flavor of some of those conditions that is one and there are some entities that will merge and the licenses of those entities that will merge have to be surrendered and then intimated to RBI',
    'So that is part of both that the kind of giving you Page 10 of 22 July 16, 2022 flavor of some of those conditions that is one and there are some entities that will merge and the licenses of those entities that will merge have to be surrendered and then intimated to RBI. So that kind of those are some examples and then when we apply and get approvals from various other authorities we need to take those approvals to get back to the regulator with those approvals and when we go to shareholders whatever is the shareholder resolution and the approvals we get it back to the regulator. So you can see that these are, I will give you some flavor of how to think about this condition, but you alluded to what about the dispensation or the glide part of the portfolio and so that is not what it is, that is something separate and that is handled as an item different from the application per se and we continue to work with the regulators on that aspect. Mahrukh Adajania: Got it Sir. My last question is on EBLR repricing, so basically your reset for retail and corporate loans will be what three months, one month. Srinivasan V: Three months or six months, mostly I think it is three months. Mahrukh Adajania: Got it Sir, that was very, very helpful. Thank you so much. Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Hardik Shah from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hardik Shah: Hi! Sir, congratulations for a good quarter. My first question is on the MTM loss. Can you share some color on AFS mix modified duration and under what circumstances one can use the IFR. Srinivasan V: Thank you for bringing this up. See the AFS book broadly you can think about this at three components, broadly three components. One is the corporate bonds; the other is the participation certificate primarily in priority sector lending participation certificates and the third one is the Government of India’s security. These are the three broad components which are there',
    'Can you share some color on AFS mix modified duration and under what circumstances one can use the IFR. Srinivasan V: Thank you for bringing this up. See the AFS book broadly you can think about this at three components, broadly three components. One is the corporate bonds; the other is the participation certificate primarily in priority sector lending participation certificates and the third one is the Government of India’s security. These are the three broad components which are there. Most of these the other aspect that you asked about is the modified duration and how you think about it. See about for two years you can think about it is the tenure of the duration and that is the time it takes to pull this too far. So from that sense we expected in a couple of years we drift back over this time period. The other aspects of the investment fluctuation reserve and what it means to these things. The investment fluctuation Page 11 of 22 July 16, 2022 reserves an appropriation of profit to set some results up and we have investment fluctuation reserves which are slightly more than 2% and at the discretion of the bank at some point in time we can utilize this, but we have not chosen to utilize investment fluctuation reserves and because it is slightly more than 2% it has to be I think regulatory 2% so there is no point getting in and given that this pulls back to par in a couple of years’ time and we are quite not comfortable to pull down the reserves and use it right now. Hardik Shah: Got it thank you Sir. My second question is on the growth side. Growth on retail has been impressive, so what are your thoughts on its sustainability given the inflation concerns that you alluded to at the start of the call. Srinivasan V: Again another good point thank you. See the retail growth ever since we came back with a credit policy getting back to pre-COVID level. If you see over a period of two, three quarters having been quite good, the December quarter was close to 4',
    'Hardik Shah: Got it thank you Sir. My second question is on the growth side. Growth on retail has been impressive, so what are your thoughts on its sustainability given the inflation concerns that you alluded to at the start of the call. Srinivasan V: Again another good point thank you. See the retail growth ever since we came back with a credit policy getting back to pre-COVID level. If you see over a period of two, three quarters having been quite good, the December quarter was close to 4.5, 5, the March quarter was close to 5 similar rate and the June quarter is 5% sequential. So year-on-year it is now cross the 20% mark the year-on-year because of the base, because we kept going down and now we are starting to build up sequential momentum is there. Within the retail book if you look at the one that I called out for the vehicle segment has been hampered by various supply chain issues. Despite that it did grow well, we did have quite a good growth, but then if you put that to the side and give more time for that to grow the retail excluding that vehicle segment grew by almost 25% year-on-year so it is again a solid growth. Then the other aspect of how to think about the environment and the growth, we do see good amount of demand across most of the products from unsecured product to secured product to mortgage product to home loans and across everywhere we do see that including the gold loan and so on. I think we have published that list of various products and the growth rate, so you can see that it is balanced across. Card loans, let us talk about credit cards the last time they want to mention',
    'Then the other aspect of how to think about the environment and the growth, we do see good amount of demand across most of the products from unsecured product to secured product to mortgage product to home loans and across everywhere we do see that including the gold loan and so on. I think we have published that list of various products and the growth rate, so you can see that it is balanced across. Card loans, let us talk about credit cards the last time they want to mention. The card loans will have a very good spend into the 4% or so sequential spend increase again discretionary if you look at the discretionary spends has gone up even more and most this growth in the car spend is driven lot of by discretion and it is discretion of course you can take it as also seasonal in the summer months or holidays months a lot of travel, entertainment, hotels and so on and so forth they are all coming back to life and you are Page 12 of 22 July 16, 2022 seeing pick up, huge pick up on that. The second aspect of the spend is that is the spend translating into loans and which to some extent it is, but to a large extent it still needs to come more it is still not fully there from a loan growth point of view it will take some more time I think over five years what the prior quarter sequential is 4.4% is the sequential growth rate in payment terms. For it to pick up and go further, we will have to wait for our people to utilize their credit lines fully still the credit line utilization on cards is that I call it at 70% to 80% of the pre-COVID level. So a lot of credit lines utilization still left to go, and the liquidity in the hands of the customers is also there, these customers from a relationship point of view about five times our customers have for the 80000 Crores of payment business balances that we have five times that we have liabilities from the similar customer segments. So we do see that people have good amount of money and line utilization to happen',
    'So a lot of credit lines utilization still left to go, and the liquidity in the hands of the customers is also there, these customers from a relationship point of view about five times our customers have for the 80000 Crores of payment business balances that we have five times that we have liabilities from the similar customer segments. So we do see that people have good amount of money and line utilization to happen. So we expect that with the pickup for that is taking place right now we need to give some more time for that to do and similarly on the revolve rates you do not, but I am sure another person would be thinking about asking so I would allude the same thing. Their revolve rate pickup also has not happened yet, first spend their needs to happen which is happening now, two, three quarters we are seeing spend happening, spend translating into loans slightly picking up sequential 4.4 picking up then the next thing is that the line utilization happens and then comes the revolving to come with that. So we are a few quarters away to get there. Hardik Shah: Got it as a follow-up to that what are your thoughts on the sustainable revolve rate going forward in the industry. Srinivasan V: See as the economy starts to pick up and people spend which you are beginning to see discretionary spends you are seeing is happening once the discretionary spends happen you will see that the people will get back to the previous. See over a period of two years both either in our bank or in some other bank people who were call it for lack of some other chronic revolvers that means habitually revolving for more than six months, nine months out of the 12 months have come down because either they are having a bad score in the bureau or they are having a bad score with us and we have utilize their limits so we are not entitled on the limits are not given because we want to be cautious',
    'See over a period of two years both either in our bank or in some other bank people who were call it for lack of some other chronic revolvers that means habitually revolving for more than six months, nine months out of the 12 months have come down because either they are having a bad score in the bureau or they are having a bad score with us and we have utilize their limits so we are not entitled on the limits are not given because we want to be cautious. So we need to wait for the things to come back and then they will start to spend and the revolve, we are quite Page 13 of 22 confident that the customer base that we have and the type of spend that they do we will get back to what we have seen in pre-COVID from the spend habits and revolve kind of attitude on that. July 16, 2022 Hardik Shah: Got it. Last question on deposit rates, you have been taking the rates higher. So how should we think about this in the next few quarters as how much hike the bank would consider taking and how is the competitive intensity increasing on that front. Srinivasan V: The pricing which we are talking about more the time deposit pricing because the other cards of course nothing and the savings account is being stable. The time deposit we have slightly only increased over the last month to two months and I have taken it up all the way what has happened and the way we think about the pricing is there are two elements to it. One, customers, we are able to get to the right kind of a customer to have the deposits and what is the price sensitivity of the customer to get those volumes',
    'The time deposit we have slightly only increased over the last month to two months and I have taken it up all the way what has happened and the way we think about the pricing is there are two elements to it. One, customers, we are able to get to the right kind of a customer to have the deposits and what is the price sensitivity of the customer to get those volumes. So that is always a kind of what we do engaging with our frontline who in turn engages with the customer, but we get that intelligence and discussion in ALCO to say how we are able to get those volumes at kind of a price point that we can get and the second aspect of our determination of the price is also competitively pricing like competitively pricing means looking at certain other banks to see that we are relevant in the market and we do not want to be price leaders by pricing up anything, but at the same time we have to be competitive within certain range that is how these are a couple of considerations we do and we discuss within the ALCO as a team and decide how we want to pitch ourselves to the customer. Hardik Shah: Got it. Thank you for your time Sir and congratulations again for a good quarter. Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kunal Shah from ICICI Securities. Please go ahead. Kunal Shah: Hi! Srini and team, thanks for taking the question. Firstly again just coming on with respect to the RBI’s approval, so any indication with respect to HDB Financial, so when we look at it in terms of the scheme of arrangement it says it has approved so would be hear further with respect Page 14 of 22 to HDB and HDFC Life or it is more or less there within the arrangements scheme. July 16, 2022 Srinivasan V: Good, thank you the other question I did not address. First the RBI approval is no objection to The Scheme of Amalgamation that has been filed. The Scheme of Amalgamation does not have a role for HDB there',
    'July 16, 2022 Srinivasan V: Good, thank you the other question I did not address. First the RBI approval is no objection to The Scheme of Amalgamation that has been filed. The Scheme of Amalgamation does not have a role for HDB there. HDB is a subsidiary, existing subsidiary of the bank and continues to be there and so the scheme of amalgamation does not have anything to do with HDB and so that is, if anything we need to do, the separate conversation is the separate process and so on. So it is not combined with this scheme, we find the scheme and the scheme does not have anything to do with HDB. HDFC Life is currently a subsidiary of HDFC Limited and it is envisaged that a merger that it will be a subsidiary of the bank. There are two things in this, one as RBI regulation a bank holding life insurance has to be 30% or below or 50% or above currently HDFC Life holding is about 47.8% or so that is a 2% plus percentage point increase that is required and that is part of another kind of a regulatory approval that we have sought that we can go to 50% plus and whatever the regulator finally tells us we will have to comply with that. So that is part of what we are waiting for, it is a continuous dialogue that happens to see how we can get to more than 50% either we get or HDFC Limited will get to 50% plus before consummation of the merger transaction. So that is on HDFC Life. Kunal Shah: But there are no timelines in terms of where can we expect, so the process is still on the communication is still on. Srinivasan V: That is correct. Kunal Shah: And secondly in terms of the overall PSL or maybe as we look at in terms of the build up towards the merger, so couple of points, one is in terms of the branch expansion we have been highlighting that 1500, 2000 odd branches could be added maybe the Q1 was not maybe we had not seen that much of a branch addition',
    'Kunal Shah: But there are no timelines in terms of where can we expect, so the process is still on the communication is still on. Srinivasan V: That is correct.

So when do we expect is it post like consummation of the merger do we see that run rate or we will start preparing for it from this fiscal and it will be more back ended and second related question is on the PSL build up. So should we say that whatever PSL certificates were bought in, in FY2022 and RIDF investments which have gone up from 9000 to 45000 Crores that was maybe with respect to Page 15 of 22 the earlier requirement and we will start building up further to meet up with the HDFC Limited’s merger how should one see that. July 16, 2022 Srinivasan V: Thank you again for that branch build up what you asked about. Yes, this quarter the branch build up was lower 36 or so, but we have about 250 branches in various stages of getting to be implemented. We are not going to wait for anything the branch build up is an organic process irrespective of any kind of an outcomes branch buildup is the right thing to do for the bank from a growth point of view that is where we are embarked on and we see opportunity. Branches that I think we talked about it again in the past branch has got two aspects to it, one you have a branch which develops the brand in the vicinity of where the branch is and draws in customers through brand attraction. The second thing is the branch is the congregation of our sales force, if we do not have branch you are going to have a sales office, you can call it that we would open x thousands of sales office',
    'Branches that I think we talked about it again in the past branch has got two aspects to it, one you have a branch which develops the brand in the vicinity of where the branch is and draws in customers through brand attraction. The second thing is the branch is the congregation of our sales force, if we do not have branch you are going to have a sales office, you can call it that we would open x thousands of sales office. So we rather open x thousands of sales because the kind of a travel that sales relationship managers need to do in their outreach to meet a customer or a prospective customer we want to keep it to 1 to 2 kilometers rather than to 4, 5 or 6 kilometers it gets in better productivity and gets in better influence to consummate that transaction right. That is part of what we have envisage everything. So the branch buildup will happen it is not waiting for anything, it is a question of a process to get that implemented, it is in progress to happen. So even in this financial year you will see some substantial branch accretion that happens. The second aspect that you touched upon is the PSL, and you touched upon the RIDF on PSL. See PSL there are several strategies to grow here, organic buildup of loans PSL eligible loans is the best method to do because it gives fantastic returns, it gives great returns going through our credit filters because we tried and tested credit filters it gives you the best returns that you can and the returns far more than the average of the bank. So we are quite enthused to do PSL organically to the extent it comes through our credit list',
    'See PSL there are several strategies to grow here, organic buildup of loans PSL eligible loans is the best method to do because it gives fantastic returns, it gives great returns going through our credit filters because we tried and tested credit filters it gives you the best returns that you can and the returns far more than the average of the bank. So we are quite enthused to do PSL organically to the extent it comes through our credit list. In the past year and two years when we have had muted retail to some extent the PSL component is also lower because we did not get the retail as much, but as we are now opening up more retail and going you see that the PSL comes back organically still it is only one of the components because we do not leave other components on the table we want all of them for example organic is one where I think we have said that it is little Page 16 of 22 July 16, 2022 more than call it in 30% to 35% or a little more than two-thirds to 70%-75% we get through organic and then there are other tools that we always use and we want to continue to use them one is the PSL certificates we get that too. the other one is the RIDF is also something where there is always a trade-off that is done what is the organic that you can build within your credit filters and if you go outside of your credit filters what sort of credit cost are you going to end up and so thereby what returns, what is the cost of the PSLC, what is the cost of RIDF and so this is always an equation that happens almost in a quarter few times that you balance this to see where is the breakeven and which is the right way to go about. So that is how decisions are done and when we did not do retail we have done more of the other things that will happen and then we do more of retail there will be more of organic that comes up. So that is how we think about the PSL',
    'So that is how decisions are done and when we did not do retail we have done more of the other things that will happen and then we do more of retail there will be more of organic that comes up. So that is how we think about the PSL. Kunal Shah: Sure so PSLC what we bought 100000 Crore maybe with HDFC it is that there is a scope for this to go up substantially from here on because 80000 has already gone up to 1 lakh last year and maybe with this requirement I think there will be more and more maybe purchase of PSLC which could happen. Srinivasan V: See purchase again as I told you these are the three, four elements that happens right PSLC, RIDF, organic PSL growth and we do participation certificates so that the several components are happening and we have to balance the cost towards the returns that each one gives. So there is no one particular target if you ask me do you know whether this 1 lakh Crores is going to go to x or y there is no predetermined formula that we operate, the formula is which gives you the best return what is the break even on indifference point between various instruments that is what drives the decision and that is as you know is a dynamic decision because the price in the market is dynamic, is not a fixed price and so that is how that is determined periodically and then the outcomes is what you are seeing. Kunal Shah: Sure, thanks a lot. Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Adarsh from CLSA. Please go ahead. Page 17 of 22 Adarsh: So just on the cost side any sense, it clearly is you are an investment mode in branches and employees. So any path towards cost to income over the next couple of years. Srinivasan V: Good, thank you for asking, but one thing normally resist from giving July 16, 2022 forward guidance on many things. But let me talk through so you will get an idea of what previously we have talked and our thought process so you will factor that',
    'Please go ahead. Page 17 of 22 Adarsh: So just on the cost side any sense, it clearly is you are an investment mode in branches and employees. So any path towards cost to income over the next couple of years. Srinivasan V: Good, thank you for asking, but one thing normally resist from giving July 16, 2022 forward guidance on many things. But let me talk through so you will get an idea of what previously we have talked and our thought process so you will factor that. One from a top line point of view the growth is picking up, you have seen that over a period of time that the top line growth, the top line means I meant the volume growth was anyway there, but the mix is also we will see like this quarter and similarly last quarter the mix is also changing to get that the top line revenue interest income, our interest income growth component also moving up you are seeing that come up, that gives you a little more kind of a confidence and an opportunity to make the right kind of investments that you want because we want to feed that from a growth point of view that is one from a balancing point of view. The second thing is in terms of the credit situation. So we have come after a pandemic credit kind of a scenario as the credit gets benign which is already you are seeing some benign credit environment and when I say credit benign means I meant from credit cost that is benign. We have that is part of what you have seen is mix of investments, making investments in people when the credit costs have been below what we have seen historically what we have seen before the COVID we have taken the opportunity to make those investments in expenses both people, technology as well as on branches. So these are the two considerations we have always given how to make those investments for the future by using the credit benign conditions and how to make an opportunity of the top line growth so that you can balance the expenses',
    'So these are the two considerations we have always given how to make those investments for the future by using the credit benign conditions and how to make an opportunity of the top line growth so that you can balance the expenses. Now coming to the last aspect which is the crux of what you are saying what is the cost to income on how we should think about. If you go back to the pre-COVID our cost to income has been 39.6 the full year before the COVID 39.6. You can call it 39 and call it 40. We have always said that as the retail picks up, retail is an upfront cost and the top line comes with the lag and comes over a two, three year period so you put the cost in and it comes over two, three years period, that is the nature of that retail once you want to grow retail that is the way it happens and you are seeing that pick up and we have said that through the COVID period even when we wanted to spend we did Page 18 of 22 July 16, 2022 not have the opportunity to spend and we have been saying that we have been waiting for that opportunity to spend to get that retail back up and now that is chugging along and so the cost to income on an overall basis call it 40 or so which is the pre-COVID quarter-to-quarter variations will happen and if you ask Sashi, I think he has told in the past in certain other meetings that quarter-to-quarter variations can happen because it is a question of the timing, but over a period of a year or two years if you see you can touch 40 but over a medium-term three to five years this is something as a forward guidance normally which we do not do but from a cost to income what we see as an opportunity we said it will get to the mid 30s and which is what we said pre-COVID but COVID has put halt to that changing the composition of the product mix as well as our spend mix and as we get back to normalization and execute we should get back to that kind of a trajectory over time',
    'Adarsh: On asset quality ex agri’s, safe to say that things are trended absolutely in the right direction. Srinivasan V: Yes. Adarsh: So what is the risk there given credit cost to income as of now it looks like it is most of the segments and what is foreseeable in future Srinivasan V: You talk about the credit right you talk about the NPA. Adarsh: No. Srinivasan V: Ex of agri it has been quite good if you see at an aggregate level and that it has got a component of the business as usual which is extremely benign because it is originated with a very tight credit conditions and it has also got a component of the restructuring some of them that to whom we are given the opportunity to redeem themselves to come back to normal life and some of them have taken that opportunity on the restructuring and used it to come back to normal life some of them who still struggle get into NPA, but on a combined basis you are seeing that it continues to get benign and better another one, two quarters you should see it is even more benign. Page 19 of 22 July 16, 2022 Adarsh: This is useful and that is it from my side. Thanks for answering my questions. Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Abhishek Murarka from HSBC. Please go ahead. Abhishek Murarka: Hi! Good evening Srini and team and congratulations for the quarter. I have two questions, one on NIM and one on Opex. On NIM the repo hike that happened in May, June when does it fully translate into yields would it be by the end of August or September and also if you can share the EBLR repo, non-repo and fixed and floating breakup for the loan book that would be useful. Srinivasan V: First on the NIM the repricing starts, it started in May and there is a cycle, there is at least a three-month cycle and some of them are a six-month cycle in terms of what happens. So that is on the NIM and so it is not just that, it has also got to do with the deposit cost',
    'Srinivasan V: First on the NIM the repricing starts, it started in May and there is a cycle, there is at least a three-month cycle and some of them are a six-month cycle in terms of what happens. So that is on the NIM and so it is not just that, it has also got to do with the deposit cost. So just the repricing on the repo or receivable, it also happens in the cost of funds, but then we do expect that the tailwind of the rates going up and if you think about the second aspect on the NIM that you asked in terms of the fixed and the variable about 45% of the book is fixed and the 55% is floating rate and some of them out of the 55%, 48% which is 27%, 28% of the total book is repo and a quarter 13%, 14% of the total bank book is achievable. So that is the kind from a mixed point of view, pricing point of view you can think that is how it moves on. Abhishek Murarka: So just extending that for the NIM outlook of course you know that there would be a certain amount of uptake in term deposit rates as well. So just generally would we still expect a retail and CRB proportions to rise in the loan mix and the expansion that you see in the yields sort of outpacing the TD uptick. So do we expect these two things to continue for the next three to four quarters. Srinivasan V: From a NIM point of view it is also rightfully you are focused on the mix because that is what makes it right because individually things can go if the mix do not come it takes a little more longer time. The mix as we speak now is still at 45-55, although the retail grew at 5% and the corporate was zero and the CRB was 2.7% sequentially. The mix is more or less the Page 20 of 22 July 16, 2022 same, one quarter does not take it, it takes a few quarters for the mix and last quarter we put out the chart in terms of how long it took for the mix to come retail 55% how long it took for that retail to come to 45% and there is the chart year-by-year it shows how long it took',
    'The mix as we speak now is still at 45-55, although the retail grew at 5% and the corporate was zero and the CRB was 2.7% sequentially.

So while on the way up it could be faster because the rate of growth on the retail and the demand in the micro environment we see on the retail is higher so it could be faster, but yes both the inherent demand we see in CRB and in retail is quite good and high and one other thing I want to be cautious and tell you to just because we think we see good demand if there is a great demand in wholesale we are not going to turn down the wholesale loan just because that the NIM has to come up, at the end of the day what matters in terms of this decision is does it give good returns at the end of the day ROA, ROE does it provide the right kind of return if it does it goes through, but from an inherent demand point because I did mention this because March the same conversation happened and we saw the wholesales come in with a greater vigor for a growth in March quarter and when it came I was not able to go back and say by the way we talked about retail and CRB having a faster growth rate inherent growth rate but the wholesale has come to decline wholesale, so we said we should go with the whatever is the demand which is there we like the customer, we like the credit right pricing gives you the return should go and so that is the kind of a decision making that happens but inherently retail and CRB are having a good amount of demand. Abhishek Murarka: Got it, thank you and the other question is on Opex',
    'Abhishek Murarka: Got it, thank you and the other question is on Opex. So can you share some sort of targets on how much you want to hire for the rest of the year and also what is your tech spend this quarter as a percentage of overall Opex where is that trending. Srinivasan V: Two things, one in terms of the hiring there is no predetermined that hiring depends on the productivity we measure all products, all geographies, branches, non-branches, customer segments, in terms of the productivity, which means the RM on the sales force give to the customer or to the sales unit. So it depends on the productivity that comes and continuously we drive the productivity up. So we have a model best-in-class model and we have a best tool and we periodically look at who and where it is sub- optimal and we drive the productivity. So that is part of how we do and the people addition we do as necessary to meet those opportunities when the Page 21 of 22 July 16, 2022 productivity is saturated we do need to add to get the more volume. So we are not shy of adding because it brings in better volumes and better relationships then your other aspect in terms of the technology, yes, I think in the past we have said the technology spend to total expenses 8%, 9% or so that is stable over a longer period of time that is the kind of range in which it operates. For quarter-to-quarter it can move around, but broadly that is where it is. Abhishek Murarka: So it would be in that 8% to 9% range this quarter as well. Srinivasan V: Yes, quarter-to-quarter it can be different but broadly that is where it goes. Abhishek Murarka: Okay got it Srini thank you that was useful and all the best for the following quarters. Moderator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this would be the last question for the day given the time I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Vaidyanathan for closing comments.

    "Rohit Jawa: Thanks, Ravi. Good evening, everyone. I'm delighted to be here for my first earnings call as the CEO and Managing Director of this great company. I look forward to engaging with all of you. Since I have come onboard in April as CEO designate, I have been spending time reconnecting with the business and meeting our people, consumers and customers. It has helped me to better understand our purpose-led future-fit business, our winning strategy and our distinctive capabilities. While so much has changed in the business over the years, what remains constant is our values, our belief that what is good for India is good for HUL and the high-quality talent that we have in the company. I have had the opportunity to also witness first-hand the on-ground impact that we have created through our working communities across the country, I'm very proud of that. We have delivered this quarter a resilient and competitive performance, which was again marked by challenging operating environment. Sensitivity: Public Page 2 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited Let me now hand over to Ritesh to cover our results in detail. I will then come back to share my perspectives about the operating environment and our outlook. Ritesh, over to you. Ritesh Tiwari: Thank you, Rohit, and good evening, everyone. I will begin with FMCG market context and then cover our quarter performance in detail. Starting with market growth for HUL relevant categories, we are seeing a gradual recovery in market volumes with aggregate volume growth now at mid-single digit. Urban markets continue to lead the growth for FMCG. Rural market volume, which at one point was declining in double digit has just turned positive in this quarter. Having said that, we need to be cognizant that these growths have come on back of volume decline in June quarter 2022",
    "Starting with market growth for HUL relevant categories, we are seeing a gradual recovery in market volumes with aggregate volume growth now at mid-single digit. Urban markets continue to lead the growth for FMCG. Rural market volume, which at one point was declining in double digit has just turned positive in this quarter. Having said that, we need to be cognizant that these growths have come on back of volume decline in June quarter 2022. If we were to look at market growth on a 2-year CAGR basis, total volume growth is still marginally negative, with rural volumes declining at 4%. With most commodities remaining stable, the year-on-year inflation continued to moderate. There are however 2 call-outs that I would like to highlight: • First, within our portfolio, we do see some divergence in commodity trends, input materials for Home Care and BPC, like crude and palm derivatives remained benign, whilst F&R commodities like coffee, cereal and skimmed milk powder continue to witness high levels of inflation year-on-year. • Second, as we said earlier, we need to be mindful that most commodities continue to be at levels higher than their historical averages. With this moderation in year-on-year inflation, we have seen more players passing on benefits of lower input cost to consumers. This is reflected in a sequential reduction in the price growth that we see in the market, albeit it being in high single digits. In anticipation of lower prices, we are seeing trade reducing the stock levels by 1 to 3 days. As we highlighted earlier, there's a time lag between companies taking price reductions and consumers experiencing the benefit of lower prices due to trade pipeline stocks. This is seen in the Nielsen offtake data where price growth is in high single digit",

This is seen in the Nielsen offtake data where price growth is in high single digit. Sensitivity: Public Page 3 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited Volumes will recover gradually due to high levels of cumulative inflation that consumers are facing and the fact that consumption habits typically recover with a lag. With softening in input cost, we are witnessing increased competitive intensity in the market. If you look at media deployment, which saw a steep reduction during high inflationary period has started normalizing and is now at 95% of June quarter 2019. With increasing share of digital spend in A&P, one can anticipate that the overall media deployment is now very similar to pre-Covid levels. We are also seeing resurgence of small and regional players in select categories and price points, many of whom had vacated the market during peak of inflation. In this backdrop, HUL delivered a resilient all-round performance. Our underlying sales grew 7% with an underlying volume growth of 3%. Both these measures strip out the impact of disposal of our salt and atta business. Talking about our bottom-line performance, EBITDA margin at 23.6% remained healthy and improved 40 bps year-on-year. I will cover the details of EBITDA movement in a subsequent slide. Profit after tax before exceptional items (PAT bei) at Rs. 2,500 crores was up 9%. Net profit at Rs. 2,472 crores increased 8% year-on-year. Slightly higher levels of restructuring cost explains the difference between Net Profit and PAT bei growth. Talking about our market share performance",

Slightly higher levels of restructuring cost explains the difference between Net Profit and PAT bei growth. Talking about our market share performance. Our growth was competitive with more than 75% of our business winning market shares, both value and volume. Premium portfolio continues to lead growth for us, and this reflects in higher share gain in this part of the portfolio. As I said earlier, we are seeing resurgence of small and regional players due to moderating commodity prices. Consequently, there are certain pockets of our portfolio, primarily in mass segment and specific regions where we have seen a dip in our market shares. However, on an aggregate basis, our shares are ahead of what it was pre-inflation. Sensitivity: Public Page 4 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited On a 2-year basis, we continue to significantly outperform the market with our sales CAGR at 13% and our UVG CAGR of 5%. Moving on to performance across our 3 segments. Home Care delivered yet another quarter of robust performance and grew 10% on a very strong base. Beauty & Personal Care delivered a volume-led growth of 4%. Foods & Refreshment grew 5%. Margins in all 3 segments remained healthy with Home Care at 18%, BPC at 26% and F&R at 18%. This time, we have included information on segment and category level UVG, which we normally do not disclose. We have done this to help you better appreciate our volume performance, especially with the divergence in the operating context of each division. Both Home Care and BPC delivered a mid- single-digit UVG while F&R had a near flat UVG',

We have done this to help you better appreciate our volume performance, especially with the divergence in the operating context of each division. Both Home Care and BPC delivered a mid- single-digit UVG while F&R had a near flat UVG. Let me give you some more color on our UVG performance across the various categories. As you can see, all categories in Home Care continue to have strong volume growth. Household Care had a double-digit volume growth where Laundry grew in mid-single digit. Moving on to BPC, Skin Care and Color cosmetics had a high single-digit volume growth driven by Ponds, Lakme and Vaseline. Hair and Oral Care had a mid-single-digit volume growth. Skin Cleansing UVG was in low single digit. When it comes to F&R, Tea continue to grow volume ahead of the market, volumes in Foods, HFD and Coffee was impacted due to price increases taken to cover the input cost inflation. Ice cream had a very high base last year and was also impacted by the unseasonal rains in April. In summary, Home Care and BPC which constitutes 75% of our business is growing volumes in mid-to high single-digit range. Sensitivity: Public Page 5 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited Hopefully, this helps you better understand our volume growth trajectory and the divergence we have seen between categories.

Sensitivity: Public Page 7 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited Softening commodities coupled with our sharp focus on savings and ensuring the right price value equation to consumers has led to our gross margin improving 140 bps sequentially, taking it to 49.2%. As I mentioned earlier, media intensity has increased in the market. We have stepped up our A&P investments to keep our Share of voice ahead of Share of Market and ensure our brands are well supported. A&P spends in this quarter was higher by 110 bps versus March quarter 2023. This is an additional investment of almost Rs. 200 crores. Summarizing our performance for this quarter, we had a resilient top line and bottom-line delivery. I've already covered most of the lines but let me give you a quick highlight on a few other items. • Our other expenses was up year-on-year due to step-up of investment in building capabilities and impact of the new royalty and central services arrangement. There was also a favorable impact in the base due to phasing of costs. • Our ETR for the quarter was 26.5%. We expect this to come down slightly on a full year basis. • I would like to remind you that our ETR in Financial Year '23 was positively benefited due to prior period tax adjustments",

We expect this to come down slightly on a full year basis. • I would like to remind you that our ETR in Financial Year '23 was positively benefited due to prior period tax adjustments. Speaking about progress made on some of our key sustainability initiatives, • HUL in partnership with HSBC and BMC has established 12 Suvidha centers in Mumbai, which provides safe sanitation facilities to 3 lakh people in low-income communities annually. During the quarter, we signed a strategic partnership with JSW Foundation to establish 10 new Suvidha centers in Mumbai. These new centers will save 300 million liters of water over a decade and will run on solar energy. • In association with Genpact, we launched Be.Seen, an accelerator program to help scale businesses owned by minority and underrepresented groups in India. This program aligns our ESG goals of increasing procurement from diverse businesses. • FICCI has set up a center for sustainability leadership with HUL as a founding member. The center aims to help accelerate India Inc.'s climate Sensitivity: Public Page 8 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited action in line with government's net-zero commitment embodied in the ‘Panchamrit’ framework. Let me now move on to our near-term outlook. The situation on weather front remains erratic. We have seen unseasonal rains, heatwave and a delayed monsoon.

    'Let me now move on to our near-term outlook. The situation on weather front remains erratic. We have seen unseasonal rains, heatwave and a delayed monsoon. El Nino has set in early, which could impact latter parts of monsoon. While monsoon has picked up pace off late, spatial variations persist. We have seen unfortunate floods in parts of the country. Consequently, cropping especially of rice and pulses seem to have been impacted. Higher reservoir levels and better agri infrastructure should hopefully contain the impact. On non-agri front, we are seeing mixed trends. While MNREGA demand remains high, remittances to rural have improved. Looking at demand from consumer lens, we should be mindful that consumers are still facing high levels of cumulative inflation. As you saw earlier, due to pipeline stocks, they are consuming higher-priced inventory and hence, the volume recovery will continue to be gradual. Clearly, the operating environment remains volatile and we should be watchful of how these variables pan out. In this context, we will continue to manage our business with agility and take actions to ensure long-term 4G growth, growth which is consistent, competitive, profitable and responsible. Speaking specifically about outlook for the next couple of quarters. • Price growth will tail off further with lapping of high prices in the base and sequential price reductions. If commodities remain where they are, we expect our price growth to be near flat or marginally negative. • With inflation moderating, the competitive intensity is likely to go up further. • We remain focused on providing superior value to our consumers, building back our gross margins and investing competitively behind our brands. With this, we expect to sustain our volume growth momentum. Sensitivity: Public Page 9 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited With this, I complete my prepared remarks, and let me pass on to Rohit for his perspectives',

With this, we expect to sustain our volume growth momentum. Sensitivity: Public Page 9 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited With this, I complete my prepared remarks, and let me pass on to Rohit for his perspectives. Rohit Jawa: Thanks, Ritesh. Let me start with my perspective of this quarter’s performance. I'll summarize this as another good quarter for HUL, delivering consistent, competitive profitable and responsible growth. On a high base, we grew 7%, equally balanced between price and volume. We have stepped up our gross margin and increased A&P investment behind our brands. Our business fundamentals remain strong - More than 75% of our business is winning shares and gaining penetration. Our brand power scores are looking healthy, product security is significantly better, and we continue to make good progress on our long-term strategic priorities. We have a clear and compelling strategy that has delivered strong results for us. Let me now turn to the operating context and our outlook. I'm pleased to see that commodities, which a few quarters back were at record levels have now corrected and inflation is moderating. Market volumes are recovering, although gradually. Rural market volume growth has just turned positive in the quarter, and we are seeing sequential improvements. However, we need to be cognisant of the soft base that the market is lapping. On a 2-year basis, total market volumes are near flat and rural market volume has declined. We expect volumes to continue recover gradually due to the high levels of cumulative inflation and the fact that consumption habits typically recover with a lag",
    "Market volumes are recovering, although gradually. Rural market volume growth has just turned positive in the quarter, and we are seeing sequential improvements. However, we need to be cognisant of the soft base that the market is lapping. On a 2-year basis, total market volumes are near flat and rural market volume has declined. We expect volumes to continue recover gradually due to the high levels of cumulative inflation and the fact that consumption habits typically recover with a lag. With inflation moderating, we are witnessing increased competitive intensity, small regional players who vacated the market during high inflation are now coming back. We're also seeing increased media investments by FMCG players. On the weather front, the situation remains challenging. We've seen some extreme weather events playing out in the last few months, such as the unseasonal rains in the summer, followed by heat phase and delay onset of monsoon. Recently, monsoon has picked up pace, and we've also seen unfortunate floods in parts of the country. El Nino has set in early and hence, that could impact the latter part of the monsoon. Sensitivity: Public Page 10 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited Clearly, the operating environment continues to remain volatile. In this context, we will continue to manage our business dynamically, provide superior value to our consumers and invest behind our brands and future-fit capabilities. Notwithstanding these near-term concerns, I remain confident and positive about the mid to long-term outlook for FMCG sector in India and HUL's growth prospects. Our focus remains on delivering 4G growth. I now hand over to Ravi to commence the Q&A session. Thank you. A. Ravishankar: Thank you, Rohit. Thank you, Ritesh. With this, we will now move to the Q&A session. We request you to kindly restrict the number of questions to a maximum of two at a time so that we are able to address questions of more participants",

In case you do have any further questions, feel free to join the queue again. In addition to audio, as usual, participants have an option to pose the questions through the web option on your screen. With that, I'd like to hand the call back to Yashashri to manage the next session for us. Moderator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. We have our first question from the line of Abneesh Roy from Nuvama Institutional Equities. Abneesh Roy: I have two questions. My first question is on the impact of palm oil price cost correction. So, when I see the biscuit companies and the other listed soap company, there, we are seeing very strong Gross margin and EBITDA margin expansion on Y-o-Y basis for the past few quarters or maybe for one or two quarters. When I see your Q1 number in terms of the Beauty and Personal Care, the margins are almost stable. So, wanted to understand if you are being more aggressive in Skin Cleansing in terms of advertising spends and promotion or giving back to the customer. Why it's not visible in terms of the volume growth? And is there a lagged impact? So, supposing you are more aggressive currently, does it mean that later you will get that benefit? Ritesh Tiwari: Yes. Thanks, Abneesh. Let me pick it up. See, overall, let me start at aggregate level. Of course, there are different cycles of commodity",

Ritesh Tiwari: Yes. Thanks, Abneesh. Let me pick it up. See, overall, let me start at aggregate level. Of course, there are different cycles of commodity. If you look at Page 11 of 36 Sensitivity: Public June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited aggregate numbers for Hindustan Unilever, there are commodities like Palm to the point that you made Crude oil, Indian rupee which has, by and large, remained stable, are factors which has led overall inflation to moderate. But equally at a total company level, we also have Food and Refreshment efficient business where Coffee, Milk, Barley are materials, which are significantly inflated. So, when you look at total company level, you're just ensure that you have looked at both the elements put together. At the peak of inflation in September quarter '22, at that point in time, we have seen a 600 bps impact to our Gross margin. Again, as you know, across the industry, this was a better performance where our price versus cost bleed was lower than many other players. From that front of 600 bps, we have already recovered 400 bps of Gross margin in the last 3 quarters between December quarter, March quarter and June quarter. And a good portion of this 400 bps Gross margin that we have improved over the last 3 quarters has gone behind A&P. It was roughly 7 percentage for us, 3 quarters back, and now, as we speak, it's almost 10 percentage. So, we have dialled up 300 bps of investment in A&P",
    "From that front of 600 bps, we have already recovered 400 bps of Gross margin in the last 3 quarters between December quarter, March quarter and June quarter. And a good portion of this 400 bps Gross margin that we have improved over the last 3 quarters has gone behind A&P. It was roughly 7 percentage for us, 3 quarters back, and now, as we speak, it's almost 10 percentage. So, we have dialled up 300 bps of investment in A&P. Of course, where required, we did lean in with price reduction, with more amount of grammage to be filled back, and we will see the impact of these changes, the point that Rohit articulated earlier that we should see impact of these changes in consumer behavior and volumes in times to come. Typically, this takes 2 to 3 quarters for the whole thing to stabilize. When we do price cuts and price changes, it goes to trade, trade has high price inventory, we liquidate that first, and it goes to consumer. Consumers also have pantry stock at home, which typically will be higher priced, bought earlier. And when that inventory in the pipeline clears up, consumers start experiencing lower priced product. And of course, after that, we expect them to start changing their behavior and start to consume more. This transition typically takes 2 to 3 quarters. And we have seen that, Abneesh in the past as well. If I go back a decade ago, for example, Laundry in 2012 & 2013, similar conversation. A year later, in Tea 2014, 2015 similar conversation. Even if I go back, say, 2008 and 2009, similar conversation for Skin Cleansing. Each of this period, we have seen substantial inflation and post Sensitivity: Public Page 12 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited that as commodities came down, we saw it took 2 to 3 quarters for consumption levels to start to recover. And we expect it to be similar this time as well. Abneesh Roy: Sure. That was helpful. Just one follow-up on that",

And we expect it to be similar this time as well. Abneesh Roy: Sure. That was helpful. Just one follow-up on that. I understood you explained on an overall basis, the Gross margins are getting flowed back. My specific question was on the Beauty & Personal Care, there why we are not seeing the margin expansion in terms of the EBIT because clearly, Skin Cleansing would have seen a very strong margin expansion. So here, my specific question is, in terms of the palm oil inventory, would you be a bit more in terms of the pricing versus, say, some of the other players? And in terms of your non Skin Cleansing, Beauty Personal Care, how is the cost inflation there? That math I'm still not able to understand. Ritesh Tiwari: Yes. So, both elements, element of (A) price actions in Skin Cleansing, (B) dialing up A&P in Skin Cleansing and equally dialing up investments behind other categories within Beauty & Personal Care. And you've seen the impacts of those. For example, we grew in double-digit Skin Care and Color cosmetics. We had good volume growth in Hair Care, Oral Care, and those are the examples where the investments that we have done in A&P across BPC categories, we are seeing impact of it coming in. And of course, overall, one of the charts you saw me presenting in media intensity has gone up it's almost back to 2019 levels. So, it's a summation of (A) we have increased Gross margin. In fact, a large portion of Gross margin of 400 bps has come from categories which got impacted in the first place through commodity, be it Laundry or be it Skin Cleansing, and hence, recovery also has been led on Gross margin on those categories",

But a mix between inflation impact, Gross margin improvement and investing in A&P behind categories. Abneesh Roy: Sure. My last question is on Oral Care. You have also done well. Our sense is the other two players listed are also doing well. So, what's the reason for all three players doing well? Is it a market share loss for the unlisted player? And second is when you see the recovery in the Oral Care versus some of your other Personal Care business, is there any difference in terms of the consumer behavior, which is driving this? Sensitivity: Public Page 13 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited Ritesh Tiwari: No, Oral Care, one of the conversations we've spoken for last few quarters, the amount of work we have done with Close up. And our performance, as we speak in this quarter, has been driven by Close up. So, Close-up has seen good traction with consumers, and our activations have worked pretty well, and so is innovation. So, we are seeing the benefit of that in terms of overall growth that we see in Oral Care. Oral Care as a category you can imagine is a highly penetrated category. Of course, there's a job to be done in terms of increasing the brushing occasion. That's a long longer-term job to be done. But the overall price value equation, the kind of distribution that we have done and the innovation activation put together, we have seen Close up basically driving the growth of Oral Care overall for us. Abneesh Roy: So, thanks. That's all for me",

Abneesh Roy: So, thanks. That's all for me. Moderator: We have our next question from the line of Vivek M from Jefferies. Vivek M: I have two questions. First, a broader question to you Rohit. So HUL is a very well-run company. But in the last few months that you have spent here, where do you think there are still some gaps that you want, that you've identified and you want to work on from a next 12-month perspective? If you can elaborate on that, that would be useful. Rohit Jawa: Thanks a lot, Vivek, for the question and happy to speak to you and hope to work again also in the future together. So, to your question, I have now been immersed last few months, as a designator, in the business meeting different customers. Our teams also the branches, and I've been to a factory or two. So, I have a sense of really how the business is and seen the impact on the ground. So first of all, let me just say that clearly, it's a great business with very, very sound fundamentals. I have come back after two decades, but I must say I'm very proud of the scale and the quality of the talent we have. I'm very proud of the impact we make in the communities through our ‘doing well by doing good’ mission. Particularly, I'm also impressed with the portfolio and the quality, the discipline of our operations, our supply chain teams",

Particularly, I'm also impressed with the portfolio and the quality, the discipline of our operations, our supply chain teams. So by and large, I would say we have a fundamentally a very strong business that's well poised for growth in the long-term story of India, which, as you Page 14 of 36 Sensitivity: Public June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited know, is very exciting, and we have very strong positions and we should be able to leverage and exploit that to grow our company to the next level and doing that by fulfilling our mission of what's good for India is good for HUL. So, I feel quite good. It's coherent and in good space. Of course, as you look forward, the country is at a moment of big inflection. We all know the opportunity, the macro tailwinds that are supporting the market. There are lots of changes, the clock speed of the country has gone up. We see the transformation on what we need to do on the portfolio, in channels and also deepening our sustainability and of course, our distinct capabilities and taking them to the next level, such as Winning in Many Indias, which I believe is a very, very strong moat. The digitization agenda, which must go to the next level, especially when it comes to our eB2B platforms like Shikhar. So, I see more opportunities than gaps, to be honest. And I think I’m in that sense, quite optimistic",

And I think I’m in that sense, quite optimistic. I do feel, of course, that there will be some jobs to be done like any other business, whether it’s to drive the opportunity of portfolio in Skin Care, or to get more and more growth in our Health Food Drinks business or for that matter, also expand the opportunity we have in the consumer-packaged foods business, which again is quite a promising space. So, all in all, I feel pretty optimistic and really it’s about us to leverage and exploit the opportunity then to actually fill any gaps. Vivek M: Great. And Rohit, one follow-up to that. Two portfolios, I want to know your specific views. One is the HFD category. And my estimate is that this quarter, it would have declined probably mid-single digits in volume terms. And since the acquisition, we have seen this portfolio probably performing lower than what the expectations were. The other bit is Beauty and Personal Care. So, on the Laundry side, you have on a phenomenal job over the last decade, but Beauty and Personal still has been somewhat lower than what the expectations would have been. So, what are your views or problem areas in both these portfolios, any specific views on this? Rohit Jawa: Yes. If you pull back and let’s take one by one, the two of them that you mentioned, I’ll ask Ritesh as well to help support my thinking',

If you pull back and let’s take one by one, the two of them that you mentioned, I’ll ask Ritesh as well to help support my thinking. If you look at basically the Health Food Drinks, it’s bang on the sweet spot of the portfolio Sensitivity: Public Page 15 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited that worked for Hindustan Unilever. It’s purposeful because it serves to fill the deficiency in micronutrients. It has huge opportunity and space for growth because only a quarter of our households use it. It’s got a very wide footprint where we could drive synergies in distribution and supply chain, which we have. It's at the moment, on business case when it comes to the cash cumulative generation, there is a job to be done when it comes to top line. And here, it's a little bit more nuanced. Some parts of the HFD portfolio have, are showing growth already. So, I would say that like Boost and some of our more premium clinical-based parts of the portfolio are in tailwinds. When it comes to the more of the core, which is where the heart of the business it has been impacted over the last few years by inflation in milk, but also in its basic cost, and that does impact consumption in heartlands. That said, we do see penetration growing. We do see market shares growing. In that sense, therefore, the business, I believe, is poised for growth, and we have to see this more in the longer term, I'm absolutely convinced that this is a great fit it's in the sweet spot in heartland of our, what we do well. What we now need to do is to make sure we get the relevance increased, and we have done that",
    "That said, we do see penetration growing. We do see market shares growing.

What we now need to do is to make sure we get the relevance increased, and we have done that. We made attempts for instance, our advertising has gone back to the core proposition of sharper, packaging is being improved. We are activating it and sampling it quite aggressively. So, we'll stay the course. We keep driving the core up in its relevance, will keep running the value up through value-added variants and building the portfolio widely, and it's a big brand, and I'm very hopeful that in the years to come, this will prove to be a very, very good part of our portfolio. So, I'll stop there on the HFD part. That's really how I think about HFD. And I think this quarter, for what it's worth we grew 10%, largely through price, but this is one of the better quarters we've had, and we'll see how the future shapes up. But in the medium to long term, we feel confident about the business and we are on it. When it comes to the BPC side, let's more specifically on the Beauty Care and Personal Care, the two parts of that business. I think we have a very high market strength where the relative market shares are high. If you take Skin Sensitivity: Public Page 16 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited Care is 4x, on hair, we have a 55-odd share. On Skin Cleansing, we are about, we are the largest player. Oral Care, we've talked about that Close up is doing quite well. Let's stick to these three big categories. So, if you look at it, we are in a very, very strong position. And the per capita consumption of all of these categories is low",

So, if you look at it, we are in a very, very strong position. And the per capita consumption of all of these categories is low. There is a huge opportunity for market development, category growth and also of course, huge opportunity for up-trading because consumers in Beauty, in Hair Care and even in Personal Wash are willing to upgrade to better formats. So specifically speaking, we already start to see in Skin Cleansing growth in our Body Wash liquids, its doubling, but it's a small base. So, 10 years down the line, that's going to be a very large share of our total Skin Cleansing. We feel quite confident about the trends we're seeing in our Skin Care portfolio, especially the premium end with Ponds and Lakme. We see tailwinds there, and we see growth coming in and high return on investment.And as far as hair is concerned, I think we have a beautiful portfolio right from Clinic Plus all the way up to TRESemme, and we will keep expanding that to serve the needs of consumers at all ends of the market. And here, again, is a beautiful market to be in high margin, high growth. So, all in all, I feel that, yes, it's true, that Home Care has been a star performer in the last decade. But that said, we do have two very large parts of our portfolio, BPC & F&R and there's only opportunity for us to leverage into the right moves on. And I'm confident that as we go forward, we'll see these components also delivering value creation to our company as they have done previously as well. I hope that is a comprehensive response to your two questions, Vivek. Vivek M: No, indeed, it was quite detailed",

I hope that is a comprehensive response to your two questions, Vivek. Vivek M: No, indeed, it was quite detailed. And second, one quick very small question on other expenses, Ritesh while you mentioned 20% and royalty impact despite that, is there any one-off setting in that number, Ritesh? Ritesh Tiwari: Yes. So, we did have one-off in the base period, Vivek, hence year-on-year when look at it, you will see the impact of coming in. If you look at sequentially what we had a number of other expenses in the previous quarter, March quarter, is very similar. The only item, as I mentioned, (A) the impact of royalty which has gotten booked in this quarter. And hence, year-on-year, that royalty and Sensitivity: Public Page 17 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited central expenses that has gone up. But apart from that and impact on the base of one-off explains by and large, what has changed year-on-year basis on that line. Plus, we also have stepped up investment in capabilities, Vivek. And that expense also basically shows the amount of investment that we have to bring into different parts of the business to dial up capabilities, and there's a conscious choice we've done to lean-in on that front as well. So those are the 3 reasons put together while you see other expenses of where they are. But suffice to say, Vivek, we do drive across length and breadth of the P&L of our savings agenda, be it trade promotions, be it supply chain cost, be it other costs",

But suffice to say, Vivek, we do drive across length and breadth of the P&L of our savings agenda, be it trade promotions, be it supply chain cost, be it other costs. And we ensure that we are able to balance between generation of savings and then deployment of savings, be it on capabilities in overheads & other expenses or be it on advertising sales promotion to dial up, as media intensity goes up. So that's how we end up managing the P&L across lines. Moderator: Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Percy Panthaki from IIFL. Percy Panthaki: Rohit, just to continue the question that Vivek asked in terms of what will be your priorities going ahead. One of the things I wanted to sort of put forth to you is the Skin Cleansing portfolio. I mean, if I look at it over a fairly long period of time, like around 15 years or so, there has been significant market share erosion in this. So just wanted to understand, I mean, what is the reason why this has happened? And what are we planning to do in order to sort of stem this decline and reverse it? Rohit Jawa: Yes. Maybe Ritesh can respond to the more near term and then I'll come back on how I see the category. Ritesh Tiwari: Yes. So let me pick up Skin Cleansing and we'll hand over to Rohit on the question you asked on long term, how does Rohit see in terms of overall evolution of FMCG. Skin Cleansing, we did call out Percy. Yes, if I look at last more than a decade, our shares are lower compared to what it was at we say a decade or 15 years ago",
    "Maybe Ritesh can respond to the more near term and then I'll come back on how I see the category. Ritesh Tiwari: Yes. So let me pick up Skin Cleansing and we'll hand over to Rohit on the question you asked on long term, how does Rohit see in terms of overall evolution of FMCG. Skin Cleansing, we did call out Percy. Yes, if I look at last more than a decade, our shares are lower compared to what it was at we say a decade or 15 years ago. Some parts of that have been portfolio choices, where a part of the Sensitivity: Public Page 18 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited segment, which was not making profit and at the lower end, we did vacate that part. That was one reason. There were also competitive reason where we lost shares in the initial part of the decade and we had called out. The learnings we had were two. Number one, product superiority; and number two, dialing up the rigor of Winning in Many Indias. And these are the exact two things that we deployed in Skin Cleansing where our propositions, LUX, for example, the way we sell LUX in North, East and South is different, the fragrance, the proposition and the overall mix that gets sold. So, we dialed up WiMI, in Skin Cleansing as number one, broad action. Number two, we dialed up big-time product superiority, as I mentioned earlier. And both these elements of action put together gave us good results. And which is why in the last couple of years, our we grew ahead of the market also gained shares. So that has been a Skin Cleansing journey over the last 10 - 15 years. The focus remains in short term, the focus for Skin Cleansing is very simple and clear, maintain competitive price value equation, whilst doing the job, as Rohit mentioned earlier, there are vectors like Body Wash, we want to ensure that, that starts growing, that's one of the market development cells, how do we accelerate growth of segments like that",

The focus remains in short term, the focus for Skin Cleansing is very simple and clear, maintain competitive price value equation, whilst doing the job, as Rohit mentioned earlier, there are vectors like Body Wash, we want to ensure that, that starts growing, that's one of the market development cells, how do we accelerate growth of segments like that. So, maintain price-value equation, dial-up market development part of the portfolio and keep doing the job of ensuring that we segment the market as Winning in Many Indias and then keep looking at the growth opportunities appropriately. So that, I would say, will summarize Skin Cleansing, but let me pass over to Rohit on long-term overall trends and growth. Rohit Jawa: Yes. Thanks, Ritesh. So to your question Percy, Skin Cleansing is a heartline of our business. We've all grown up in this company selling a Lifebuoy. So that is really, really close to all of us. And I think, so I think over the medium to long term, the Skin Cleansing consumption because per capita consumptions are low, is going to grow up both in terms of volume and value, because just the share nature of the secular effect. So, we need as the market leader, our job is to really grow the market. So I see 3 big levers was to follow. Number one, given that we are almost a $1 billion Page 19 of 36 Sensitivity: Public June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited business there, our first job is to play the portfolio smartly, which is through price segments, central benefit segments, and we have really good brands, as you know, right from Lifebuoy, LUX, Dove, Pears, Hamam, Indulekha now as well entering the sort of source segment. So, first job is to make sure we play the portfolio, full portfolio and make sure that we are smart when it comes to price value equation, Winning in Many Indias is pretty much what Ritesh spoke",
    "So, first job is to make sure we play the portfolio, full portfolio and make sure that we are smart when it comes to price value equation, Winning in Many Indias is pretty much what Ritesh spoke. The second point of emphasis is on premiumization because consumers are up trading. We do see that on growth rates and for instance, in our premium part of the portfolio, where Pears and Dove have shown smart growth, and we expect that to continue, so in urban areas, for instance. So that's the second driver. And the third driver of value is new formats and regimes. So even though it's quite small, the shower gels, growth are doubling, but this will get close to the 20% mark in the medium term because that's what happens to liquids when they become accessible very close to soaps, in terms of cost per wash. So, we expect liquids to grow, including regimes like scrubs and bath and shower experiences. So, there's a lot of growth that exists in basically getting consumers to expand and upgrade their shower experiences. So yes, that's really see very optimistic, and we'll continue to drive the innovation in our portfolio to leverage these 3 drivers that I mentioned. Percy Panthaki: Right. My second question is a little bit more on the near term. So, you mentioned in your PPT that soon the pricing growth will become flat or even negative on a Y-o-Y basis. So, in light of this, how do you see the volume responding? And how do you see the overall sales growth in light of this? Like in the longer term, HUL has done a high single digit, 9% type of overall sales growth. Do you think that with the pricing being flat, this number is at risk? Or do you think that the volume growth would pick up to a high single digit in the second half to sort of keep the overall revenue growth in line with the longer-term average? And if you think that is the case, then what really will drive that change from a 4%, 5% or 3%, 4% to 8%, 9% kind of a number? Ritesh Tiwari: Let me pick it up, Percy",
    "Do you think that with the pricing being flat, this number is at risk?

And if you think that is the case, then what really will drive that change from a 4%, 5% or 3%, 4% to 8%, 9% kind of a number? Ritesh Tiwari: Let me pick it up, Percy. So, see, overall, let me start with market to start with. This quarter, as we speak, market grew volume in mid-single digit. Same period last year, market had declined volumes by 6 percentage. And hence, one Page 20 of 36 Sensitivity: Public June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited of the things we spoke on the chart when you look at a 2-year number, CAGR market volumes are roughly flat over 2 years. As far as HUL is concerned, we had 6% volume growth in period last year and a further 3% growth this year. So over 2 years, we've grown a 5 percentage of our volumes. So, volume trajectory is very strong and robust in comparison to where markets are growing. And hence, that's also the reason Percy, why over 2-year period, we have substantial outperformance compared to the market. And hence, we also gained compared market share in the last 2 years substantially. That's number one. Number two, when I look at in short-term here and now, market is in transition. The point I was mentioning to Abneesh earlier that whenever you see substantial increase in commodity cost and then commodity cost comes off, it takes 2-3 quarters for market volumes to recover. (A) Trade does destocking, and we have seen across categories anywhere from one to three days, trade has destocked because they do want to ensure that they are able to get out the high price inventory before they source and they stock up lower price inventory. And consumers, of course, end up experiencing the lower price inventory a little later",
    "(A) Trade does destocking, and we have seen across categories anywhere from one to three days, trade has destocked because they do want to ensure that they are able to get out the high price inventory before they source and they stock up lower price inventory. And consumers, of course, end up experiencing the lower price inventory a little later. You also see the divergence between the price growth that we as a business, we declared this quarter, we spoke about 4% price growth to our business, by and large, which is coming off the price that we've taken in the previous period. Market had shown a price growth in this quarter of 8 percentage. So, there's always a lag between what we end up doing as businesses and what market ends up showing. So, this transition, and I was quoting 3 periods, 2012, 2013 Laundry, year after Tea, if I go back to 2007 and 2008, in terms of Skin Cleansing, each of these periods, we saw 2-3 quarters, so market will be in transition and the volume recovery of the market will be gradual. In short term, as we speak, this will be the reality in terms of overall gradual volume recovery of the market. Price growth in short term, we called out that if commodities remain where they are, I do expect our price growth to be either flat or marginally negative. So, the growth for the next couple of quarters will be fully led by volume. Sensitivity: Public Page 21 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited Now of course, this is a transitionary period. Long term, FMCG industry grows by both volume and price. So once the cyclical trends settle in, now, of course, that's anybody's guess when the price tables commodity settle in, but we had called out at the peak of inflation even in September 22, that commodities are cyclical in nature. Ultimately high-price impacts demand, high demand impacts price, and they do normalize the curves",
    "Long term, FMCG industry grows by both volume and price. So once the cyclical trends settle in, now, of course, that's anybody's guess when the price tables commodity settle in, but we had called out at the peak of inflation even in September 22, that commodities are cyclical in nature. Ultimately high-price impacts demand, high demand impacts price, and they do normalize the curves. And which is why we did see that the inflation started moderating of any commodity which had significant amount of inflation. Now with that getting let me say just stabilize. Hopefully, in near to medium terms post some quarters, we should start seeing this equilibrium coming back. Coming back, which was a high price growth situation, which was there, let me say, last year in several quarters. And a situation now where, as I mentioned, next couple of quarters, we do see volume leading growth. And hopefully, if commodities do stabilize, hopefully industry goes back to what its long-term trends are, roughly 1/3 or 40% comes from price and what about 2/3 or 60% comes from volume, that equilibrium should start getting established. Price did lead growth. You've seen our overall numbers in last year as well. Last Financial Year, we had roughly 11% - 12% pricing. Now that pricing is no more there for the next couple of quarters, and hence, overall amount of absolute growth, to your point, will be very different and growth will be led by volume. And how much volume we sell, as I mentioned, depends upon this transition, how quickly it settles in across different parts of the country, and across different categories. This, of course, external environment, we spoke about, be it rural demand or for it matter, be it weather related uncertainties. We have to put all that into mix. But in summary, I do see next couple of quarters to be in transition. Percy Panthaki: Right, Ritesh. Thanks very much. That's all for me",

Moderator: We have our next question from the line of Manoj Menon from ICICI Securities. Manoj Menon: Team, I know that there's maybe two questions, but allow me to ask three. Basically, the first one is actually on the inflation part of it from a consumer lens. It's been Ritesh, first of all, I want to thank you for making it very clear Page 22 of 36 Sensitivity: Public June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited about the interplay between inflation and the volume price elasticity, how the consumer sees it. Rohit actually from your global experience, if you could actually call out a few examples or learning actually on, let's say, how the interplay plays out. Because we are in a unique situation in India where from a consumer staples, it's an industry point of view, where we have actually seen material inflation in the last couple of years versus, let's say, which is not the case from a consumer lens 5-6 years prior to that. So how do you see actually this, I don't want to call deflation, but let's say, lower inflation or deflation from a consumer lens. That's question number one. Second actually, on the GSK part of the nutrition part of it, how do you see actually the issues which you have as a company in terms of solving the consumer problems. The third is, it's more of an observation than a question",
    "So how do you see actually this, I don't want to call deflation, but let's say, lower inflation or deflation from a consumer lens. That's question number one. Second actually, on the GSK part of the nutrition part of it, how do you see actually the issues which you have as a company in terms of solving the consumer problems. The third is, it's more of an observation than a question. When I look at more of the listed space in consumer staples in India currently, it appears that most companies are trying to solve the problem in the premium end, not necessarily at the bottom of the pyramid. Let me explain that, for example, at least I don't hear from any listed consumer, a staple company talking about, let's say, solving the or creating the next Fair and Lovely or Glow and Lovely or the Wheel. So, three questions. Ritesh Tiwari: Inflation, I think good reflection Manoj you are posing. If you look at market price growth, FMCG, over 2 years, we've seen overall as an industry, there has been 22% price increase. This is substantial and which is why the impact on volumes is no surprise. The point I mentioned earlier, a 5% volume growth on the back of a 6% volume decline of the industry. And hence, 2 years CAGR has been flat on volume front. That has been the impact of these categories. In the meantime, we did see this got more pronounced at the beginning of the inflation on discretionary categories. Mass Skin Care got impacted, how's Health Food Drinks got impacted where the bite was higher and consumers basically did more prioritization on kitchen inflation and hence kitchen essentials and they did dial back on discretionary category. Sensitivity: Public Page 23 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited Now is this and I spoke to the point earlier of elasticity. So, we do see this coming up in terms of in the next couple of quarters, we do see gradual recovery happening in overall consumption trends",
    "Sensitivity: Public Page 23 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited Now is this and I spoke to the point earlier of elasticity. So, we do see this coming up in terms of in the next couple of quarters, we do see gradual recovery happening in overall consumption trends. Overall, if I see within the portfolio, Skin Care, if I look at Skin Cleansing, Hair, Laundry, bulk of the commodities, which impact these parts of the portfolio have seen moderation. Of course, the point still remains over 2 years, there is cumulative inflation, but it has seen moderation. Income levels to some extent have caught up. Rural demand to some extent has got supported because of this inflation getting moderated. And equally, the job now has to be on driving more volume and driving more consumption. That remains the focus area for us. Keeping aside the price elasticity of these categories, the job of in medium to long term on market development, on making the portfolio more premium on entering high demand spaces. That remains a fundamental for us, product superiority, driving WiMI, that remains a fundamental for us. And that's a playbook in terms of driving growth in the business. So that's basically overall the inflation playbook. And the point I was mentioning earlier, there are still parts of the portfolio. Milk, Cereals, mostly barley in this case, and Coffee, substantial inflation we have seen in these commodities. And like, I'm hoping like crude like vegetable oil, these also will be cyclical in nature and these commodities will start deflating in times to come. But there's always an interaction of price inflation and demand for these commodities. So that interplay we have seen in India, we're seeing across the world in many markets, emerging markets. At least in India, we don't have a large interplay on currency at this point in time",
    "And like, I'm hoping like crude like vegetable oil, these also will be cyclical in nature and these commodities will start deflating in times to come. But there's always an interaction of price inflation and demand for these commodities. So that interplay we have seen in India, we're seeing across the world in many markets, emerging markets. At least in India, we don't have a large interplay on currency at this point in time. But we've seen in many international markets, Latin American markets, currency ends up playing a very large implication on overall inflation and hence price tables. Indian rupee after having, I would say, to some extent, depreciated last year, the last 6 to 8 months' time, it has remained pretty stable, and that has helped overall inflation in the economy. As I come to GSK, there have been multiple jobs that we have to do, as I was articulating earlier. We had a job of integration, which the job has been pretty well executed. Go-to-market has got fully integrated, business has been onboarded. We had a job to be done in terms of correcting the price value Sensitivity: Public Page 24 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited equation. We launched sachets and ensured that we're able to increase access to sachets and small price point packs Market development at scale, almost last year, we spoke about 45 million plus home-to-home contacts to ensure that we're able to educate on the benefits of Health Food Drinks, where the food palate by and large, is carbohydrate heavy and micronutrient deficient, how Horlicks ends up playing a role in supporting that and missing that meal plate more balance. So that job of educating and increasing the relevance of the category and driving consumption is the single biggest focus area",
    "So that job of educating and increasing the relevance of the category and driving consumption is the single biggest focus area. As part of that, we did the job of activating Boost across the country, we did the job of ensuring that the plus range backed by high sciences has got activated, and we're seeing good amount of growth in that part of the business. So, in summary, all relevant jobs to be done in terms of building penetration, building relevance of the category and boosting consumption has been in play. Inflation has played a spoilsport. Earlier, we had a peak of as we acquired the business, as you know, we had this was a peak of COVID and post that, a very high amount of inflation as a basket overall and then our overall inflation impacting in particular HFD category milk essentially. So those impacts have overall had a tell on the HFD growth. And you saw in this quarter, we had a value growth, but volumes were just below flat, to marginal decline. But medium to long term, we do see for this category, our ability to build relevance through market development and focus on driving growth remains and we are very confident about that. Let me hand over to Rohit, on the premium end and the mass segment, how do we ever play at both the end FMCG market. Rohit Jawa: Yes. Thank you. I think this is to really simplify this. The first point to note is that we're a highly penetrated company with reach 9 out of 10 households, multiple categories, and we are of the scale because we have over the years played the full portfolio. So, from the lower to the middle to the upper price segments. So, if you look at if you consider that context, the second point is that we are, therefore, two big parts of the portfolio. There's a core, which is really what Page 25 of 36 Sensitivity: Public June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited drives our baseline",
    "So, from the lower to the middle to the upper price segments. So, if you look at if you consider that context, the second point is that we are, therefore, two big parts of the portfolio. There's a core, which is really what Page 25 of 36 Sensitivity: Public June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited drives our baseline. And this is all about getting the right what you call sometimes mass, but it's basically the one that gets us to every household, gives us that reach in distribution in GT, but also in every home. And this is where we got to make sure we have the right price quality equation, the right mix, right region, which you call WiMI. And this is what drives the fundamental baseline of the business. This doesn't take away from the fact that as for the growth is coming from the premium end, which is about 1/3 of the business now growing faster. And here, in fact, much of the focus of our innovations, our A&P spends, our market development and our portfolio expansion is happening. So, we are focused on both the end and drive the core usership, keep it healthy, keep the baseline humming and drive the growth of our premium end because that's the secular trend of the market and make the right investment in mixes, innovations, market development and portfolio expansion. So, I hope this answers your question on how we see these to sort of simplify the ends of the business. Manoj Menon: Thank you, Rohit, and thank you, Ritesh, for response. Sorry, if I may if I can push an envelope a bit. Rohit actually, the context I was trying to get from you in the call today, this is the first call. When you take a step back and go 2013, maybe longer in the history, HUL or Unilever in those days or HLL in those days created, a Fair and Lovely, created a Clinic Plus, Wheel etc",
    "Manoj Menon: Thank you, Rohit, and thank you, Ritesh, for response. Sorry, if I may if I can push an envelope a bit. Rohit actually, the context I was trying to get from you in the call today, this is the first call. When you take a step back and go 2013, maybe longer in the history, HUL or Unilever in those days or HLL in those days created, a Fair and Lovely, created a Clinic Plus, Wheel etc. The context is that today, it appears that the strategy does not necessarily have those ingredients saying that, look, we're not going to, let's say, solve the problems of bottom of pyramid from a brand point of view, we'll probably solve the problem from a, let's say, pricing per unit point of view. That is my only question about the premium versus BOP. Rohit Jawa: Yes. So I think the what we talked about is, indeed, about category expansion. We have, we do have the right brands like Taaza, Wheel, Lifebuoy, LUX, Glow and Lovely, these are deeply penetrated solutions, and you're right. We want to make sure that they keep serving the consumers in the right way, and they still have a lot of runway of growth. When it comes to category creation, the category creation is going through the underserved areas, new benefits, and we are building brands there, TRESemme is a great example, Sensitivity: Public Page 26 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited excellent vibrant brand did not exist many years ago. Now it has helped us increase our market share in the hair category to well over 50. The brand is positioned on a new trend, it's a salonization trend and is doing very well. And equally, there are brands that will get stretched even for the premium for instance Lakme, to solve the beauty needs of every Indian. And there is a segment that's emerging that Lakme will serve. So, I think our thesis of growth continues to be at the primary level market development, category growth because that's a story of India for the next many, many years to come",

So, I think our thesis of growth continues to be at the primary level market development, category growth because that's a story of India for the next many, many years to come. So yes, it is a part of our genetic code. Manoj Menon: And one last thing, if I may ask a follow-up. If Rohit from your global experience actually, when a country or a geography which you cover, moves from, let's say, significant inflation to lesser inflation to, let's say, deflation or rather lower inflation. So how do you manage the P&L? Because these are things which are not that easy to handle. The reason I'm asking because when I look at India in the last, let's say, 10 years. India has really not seen material inflation, which I presume most consumer staples CEO and CFO would allow to see it because that's where you get operating leverage from. In the last few years, you have seen material inflation that's been a tailwind in different ways, let's say, in a home care segment or digital segment, etc. Now it's actually reversing. So, anything from your global experiences on handling the inflation to lesser inflation, stroke deflation would be super helpful. Rohit Jawa: Yes, I think there's collective knowledge and experience of the company, and we've been through cycles in India a few times. And as Ritesh mentioned, we've seen analogies of what have happened, of course, it might not exactly be the same because things do change in the number of factors that play may be different. We are, at the moment, specifically focused on driving competitive volume growth. That at one level is on the top line job. And at the bottom line, we do have tailwind of reducing commodity costs",
    "And as Ritesh mentioned, we've seen analogies of what have happened, of course, it might not exactly be the same because things do change in the number of factors that play may be different. We are, at the moment, specifically focused on driving competitive volume growth. That at one level is on the top line job. And at the bottom line, we do have tailwind of reducing commodity costs. Some of that we are passing in higher A&P investments. We want to keep our brands strong, penetration is Sensitivity: Public Page 27 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited growing. And we do have our productivity program Symphony to drive the savings. So, it's really about, from a margin point of view, its about driving the levers of pricing, mix and cost and we know that machine well. And from a top line point of view is to drive volume growth competitively in the quarters to come. Thereafter, I think when price returns back to the market or in our categories, we will go back to, we hope, the organic trend of about 2/3 volume and one- third price but driving volume and mix in any case is absolutely the most virtuous thing to do, which is what we focused on at this point. Moderator: We move on to our next question from the line of Arnab Mitra from Goldman Sachs. Arnab Mitra: My first question is your comments around the resurgence of local competition, especially in Laundry and Tea. So given, again, your past experience, what do you expect here? Does this mean that some of these categories could have a bit of a subpar growth for a year as the market conditions normalize? And therefore, the market share is normalized between local players and national players. And also in Laundry specifically and Tea does it really affect the lower end of your portfolio? Or does it also affect the entire price ladder, which includes premiumization into your premium brands? Ritesh Tiwari: Yes. Thanks",
    "And also in Laundry specifically and Tea does it really affect the lower end of your portfolio? Or does it also affect the entire price ladder, which includes premiumization into your premium brands? Ritesh Tiwari: Yes. Thanks. And as you called out, in this period when we have seen a very high amount of inflation and inflation high is one element, but second important element is huge volatility. And this is a time where the business model becomes a little more tricky to manage, and that's the time we have seen that players did vacate the market. And now as we have seen commodities moderating, we've seen more number of players participating in the market, especially small players. The whole conversation comes on the ability to manage such amount of variations in the business model. And we have seen more players now participating. One of the charts that we have put earlier that because of that, we did see in Tea in overall Laundry that the small players are growing ahead of the large players because there are more players participating in the market. And by and large, these conversations is in the lower price point of the market. Now when I look at Tea, apart from this the question we mentioned earlier, the current tier Page 28 of 36 Sensitivity: Public June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited Tea commodity cycle led to a widening of gap between premium tea and loose tea. In nowhere else across the portfolio, we have seen downgrading happening. The point as mentioned quite a few times earlier, we did see consumers seeking value and either uptrading or downtrading, but we’re not seeing downgrading happening. In tea, given the divergence of premium tea and loose tea, we saw consumers downgrading. And we do have brands like Taaza, which has done pretty good business. So that's one clear job. When it comes to overall price value equation, the interaction usually in this part of the market is in the mass segment",

When it comes to overall price value equation, the interaction usually in this part of the market is in the mass segment. There is never an interaction between, let me say, a mass brand, let me say, mass brand and a premium brand. That interaction doesn't exist. It's usually within the price point. And also the fact is the cumulative inflation has been pretty significant. The point I mentioned market price per se over a 2-year period has seen 22% inflation in terms of price increase. So even in our hard business, we've seen cumulative inflation of 18% NMI. So there has been a pretty high amount of inflation and hence linked pricing decision. These equations in my mind will settle as commodities overall stabilize, the overall segments of the market, they become normalized. And then the job that we typically have, the point we spoke earlier of price volume balancing to a historical norm, whatever 2/3, 1/3 60-40 that keeps happening. And also mentioned, just to complete Arnab I'm sorry, that over this 2-year period, where we've seen the players basically vacating the market. We've seen players coming back to the market over 2 years, this inflation period, we have grown significantly ahead of the market. And our market shares today are higher than what they were before the inflation started kicking in materially. Arnab Mitra: Sure",
    "And also mentioned, just to complete Arnab I'm sorry, that over this 2-year period, where we've seen the players basically vacating the market. We've seen players coming back to the market over 2 years, this inflation period, we have grown significantly ahead of the market. And our market shares today are higher than what they were before the inflation started kicking in materially. Arnab Mitra: Sure. And similar to what you said about the consumer adjusting to the price, this market share or, let's say, market forces adjustment, would you expect this also to be a 2-3 quarter kind of phenomenon? Or this could be like a full year reset where you had gone to a much higher level of share in the market, which probably somewhere in looking you started and where you ended last year. Ritesh Tiwari: Yes. So, these players coming back is more of a last couple of quarters phenomenon as commodity started moderating. And in our mind where Page 29 of 36 Sensitivity: Public June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited commodity levels are today, they are by and large, they have got moderated. Now something can go up and down, we'll see in times to come. So hence, the let me say, more players participating has got fully paid out. Now of course, the year-on-year implication in the next few quarters. But sequentially, in our mind, I'm saying that players have participated more, so that has got played out. Arnab Mitra: Sure. Understood. And my last question is on your margin side. So, as you take up your A&P spends, if you look back, you had this 11.5% to 12% A&P spend for many years. All other things remaining same, should that be the broader level of A&P spend that you need to be? To support market development, normal market conditions over a period of time. And therefore, if there is any expansion in EBITDA margin it would only happen if your Gross margin expansion is higher than the level of A&P increase we tried to get to that level",
    "So, as you take up your A&P spends, if you look back, you had this 11.5% to 12% A&P spend for many years.

And therefore, if there is any expansion in EBITDA margin it would only happen if your Gross margin expansion is higher than the level of A&P increase we tried to get to that level. So just trying to understand that dynamic between A&P and Gross margin. Ritesh Tiwari: Sure. To the point, I mentioned earlier that with the peak of inflation, we did have a 600 bps impact on our Gross margin. We built that 400 bps out of that in last 3 quarters. And a bulk part of that got invested behind A&P. Now A&P, there are always 2 ways we look at it. It is not the percentage turnover that typically drives the model, investment model in this space. We always look at the reach objective and the frequency objective to ensure that we've been able to communicate the messages of our brands to our consumers and ensure that innovations land in the marketplace. So, there's always a, let me say, a bottom-up way in which we compute is to watch the amount of investment that we require in a category or a brand for that matter in the quarter. Second is always a competitive element where overall media heat goes up, the point that I spoke in one of the charts that, we're almost back to 2019 levels now where the media intensity has been. That's the second element which determines the absolute amount of investment that we got to do in A&P. The bottom-line principle still remains, Share of Voice ahead of Share of Market. Now with peak inflation, the point I mentioned earlier of in our case, for example, 18 percentage",
    "Second is always a competitive element where overall media heat goes up, the point that I spoke in one of the charts that, we're almost back to 2019 levels now where the media intensity has been. That's the second element which determines the absolute amount of investment that we got to do in A&P. The bottom-line principle still remains, Share of Voice ahead of Share of Market. Now with peak inflation, the point I mentioned earlier of in our case, for example, 18 percentage. With peak inflation, we had seen overall media Sensitivity: Public Page 30 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited intensity had come down as the price versus cost bleed across industry went up. And in our case, we had lower price versus cost bleed at margin. So, we have seen at those levels, media intensity came down, which is starting to come up. So, will this go from here higher media intensity? I do expect the short-term that to further happen, which is why we did call out that if I look at next few quarters, the priority remains - single important line of margin remains Gross margin. Idea is to keep building gross margin and invest competitively behind A&P. EBITDA margin for the next few quarters will be an outcome. Now where we are at this point in time, 23.6 percentage even last few quarters approximately at 23.5 percentage. It's a pretty healthy margin, and which is why our objective is to drive gross margin and invest in A&P. EBITDA margin will be an outcome of what evolved in terms of development of commodity hence Gross margin and what evolves in terms of A&P investment need to maintain SOV ahead of SOM. So, it will be more of an outcome of the two, but the focus will remain on driving gross margin. Moderator: We have a next question from the line of Richard Liu from JM Financial. Richard Liu: One thing that struck me is that your earlier comments on rural slowdown bottoming out seems to be missing from the deck this time around",
    "So, it will be more of an outcome of the two, but the focus will remain on driving gross margin. Moderator: We have a next question from the line of Richard Liu from JM Financial. Richard Liu: One thing that struck me is that your earlier comments on rural slowdown bottoming out seems to be missing from the deck this time around. And instead, you introduced a new comment on weather-related issues. Can you give a perspective on whether there's any change in your reading of what's happening on the ground on rural? And how should we look at the progression here on. You need may be more circumspect than before on this front? Ritesh Tiwari: Sure, sure. So rural, as you called out for the last few quarters that slowdown has bottomed out. And indeed, this time, in fact, we did not repeat that comment because we also spoke hard numbers as well. Let me summarize 3 or 4 elements, Richard, in rural. First, we had seen in these last few last quarter, year, year and a half, double-digit volume decline of the rural market. And from that space, as we spoke in the latest quarter, market for rural has turned positive and say market was 2% up. Still job to be done. If I look at 2 years CAGR, rural has a 4% circa 4% volume decline, but it is definitely looking up compared to what it was. Sensitivity: Public Page 31 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited So there are a few elements which are helping this recovery. Where it has bottomed out and now it's on the path of recovery. And what's helping this recovery. Overall, inflation moderating and hence, overall commodity, we have given commodity linked savings we passed on, in terms of volume, in terms of price reduction. That is one thing which is helping rural recovery, number one. Number two, we are very conscious that government has maintained its heightened amount of rural expenditure. That supports overall situation of income levels in rural area",
    "Where it has bottomed out and now it's on the path of recovery. And what's helping this recovery. Overall, inflation moderating and hence, overall commodity, we have given commodity linked savings we passed on, in terms of volume, in terms of price reduction. That is one thing which is helping rural recovery, number one. Number two, we are very conscious that government has maintained its heightened amount of rural expenditure. That supports overall situation of income levels in rural area. Third, the amount of capex, which government has committed last fiscal, this fiscal put together, and we have seen capex investments going up, including states spending money. And ultimately, as that happens, we know the non-farm income does get benefited in the rural area. If I look at data for the last few months' time, I do see remittances improving. Rural wages, yet we have seen the point are on a real-term basis, are almost flattish. It has a small margin decline as we saw previous quarter. Now it's come back to almost being flat on a real basis. So, there are forces which are supporting and helping at this point in time on many fronts. The only place where we have to watch out is the impact of monsoon and weather-related risk. El Nino has come earlier, and we know that when it comes early in the season grows more in the season. So, we have to see what impact that has. And we know that it's not on the quantity of rain, it's also where the rain distribution happens, that's equally important. And, timing of the rain is equally important. So, all 3 quantity, timing and placement of the rain, all 3 have to work to ensure that the monsoon supports the overall agri growth and hence, overall rural growth. That is one element is what we called out as part of unknown and all of us need to learn and we can watch out. We did see some floods in parts of the country in the last few weeks. So that is also a reality we are facing at this point in time",

That is one element is what we called out as part of unknown and all of us need to learn and we can watch out. We did see some floods in parts of the country in the last few weeks. So that is also a reality we are facing at this point in time. And this is why the only single business risk we called out is weather everything else is looking good. I've seen data on MNREGA, more enrollments, but I'm hoping and assuming that with capex spend, boosting remittances, that should help overall the non-farm income component of the Sensitivity: Public Page 32 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited rural economy. So yes. So that's in summary, I would say the encouraging signs, weather in my mind, is the only watch out. Richard Liu: Sorry, Ritesh. Ritesh, second question, and you've alluded to this a bit already, but let me try my luck once again on this rather massive growth in other expenses this quarter. To put it more simply, this is a line that we are used to seeing growing low to mid-single digits. And that's why I'm finding it difficult to see this 10% to 15% kind of growth in this line even if I were to strip out the impact of the higher royalty. Wanted to get a flavor from you on this step-up in growth on this line? And what are the factors that's driving a different but a higher level of cost growth versus what we're used to seeing in the past? Ritesh Tiwari: The 2 lines, let me speak, Richard, I know you asked me about line. Let me talk about 2 lines. I'll talk about line, which is other expenses, we also talk about a line called exceptional items that we are restructuring. So let me start with the expenses. Other expenses this quarter is very similar to what we had in the last March quarter",
    "Let me talk about 2 lines. I'll talk about line, which is other expenses, we also talk about a line called exceptional items that we are restructuring. So let me start with the expenses. Other expenses this quarter is very similar to what we had in the last March quarter. In the base period I was responding to Vivek earlier, we had a one-off in the base, which impacts the year-on-year read. Of course, we had seen salary inflation, which we have passed on to. We have done salary increases in the system which was one driver of cost increase. We have seen capability investment in the business, which has led to increase in cost. You did call out, of course, increase year-on-year on royalty and central services. And investments behind capabilities. If I look at even all these elements put together, and if you look at total expenses that we have at Hindustan Unilever, then I compare across industry, we are still at the lower end of the industry benchmark on other expenses. So, we are extremely economical the way we run. We have a frugal mindset, any cost, which is adding value to consumer gets prioritized. Everything else we have extremely frugal mindset. We have savings program to drive cost of other expenses also down. To give you an example, look at the distribution expenses, it is part of other expenses. One of the items we have spoken about our entire job of driving lesser number of kilometers of product needs to travel before it gets out to the customer. Items like that we are driving in the system. So, we're looking at our infrastructure as part of Nakshatra over distribution setup",

If I look at overall other expenses, if I look at manufacturing expenses Sensitivity: Public Page 33 of 36 June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited in supply chain, we called out even in the space of Horlicks which I was responding earlier, that one of the jobs that we have, we still have more space to go in terms of driving supply chain synergies and cost transformation in area of HFD. Current quarter, we invested in restructuring expenses to drive better cost structures in HFD and we have more work to be done in supply chain in HFD to drive cost reduction. And there are other elements in the system we are working on. So and you will see that those expenses as time comes relevant, whereas part of Nakshatra, we will invest restructuring expenses to ensure that we're able to lower our supply chain manufacturing cost. Sans the procurement cost of materials, and we will drive them down by ensuring that we spend on restructuring as required to lower our supply chain expenses. So, you will see some amount of movements on these expenses overall. But you will see always us being at a benchmark level. Across the industry, you will see that we will operate always at the lower end of the industry in terms of overall costs that we end up having. Quarter-on-quarter, there'll be some puts and takes as explained. But overall, is assured, that's a line which has a hawk-eye attention in the organization, and we run with a frugal mindset. A",

Ravishankar: What we'll do now is take one question from the web and then we'll call it time. So, there's a question from Latika. On 3 parts to the question. One is what's the impact that trade destocking had in the quarter? Second, she says that you mentioned, it takes 2 to 3 quarters for consumer behavior to change. In some categories like Skin Cleansing, price reduction started 2 quarters ago, and Laundry, Shampoos, etc, perhaps it started a quarter back. So, is it reasonable to expect volume growth recovering to 6% to 8% in the second half of the fiscal? And the third one is around rural and whether our optimism on rural recovery is lower versus what it was a quarter ago given the weather risks. Ritesh Tiwari: Yes. So, thanks, let me just pick up the 3 or 4 questions together. So, the trade destocking, of course, is always linked to the price change that we end up doing. We did speak about price change in the previous quarter. But even in current quarter, Latika, we have done price changes in Skin Cleansing and in Laundry. And of course, the trade an overall impact of volume recovery and Page 34 of 36 Sensitivity: Public June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited overall trade impact in pipeline, basically will be 2-3 quarters as we finish doing all this job. Now where commodities are today. As we saw in current quarter, we have spoken a number of small amount marginal amount of deflation effect we saw in commodity costs",
    "And of course, the trade an overall impact of volume recovery and Page 34 of 36 Sensitivity: Public June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited overall trade impact in pipeline, basically will be 2-3 quarters as we finish doing all this job. Now where commodities are today. As we saw in current quarter, we have spoken a number of small amount marginal amount of deflation effect we saw in commodity costs. And which is why in this quarter, we did do price decrease of this new price has further landed in the market. If you look at the price growth that Nielsen, for example, has spoken, they're talking 8% price growth. That's what consumers are paying at this point in time, where we have a 4% price growth as we declared our results. So, there's still a transition as you speak, happening in the trade, because of the latest set of price decreases that we did in the quarter. And that's the point I was making that we finished doing these price decreases. And assuming no further commodity up and down happens, this is the point where 2-3 quarters it will take for overall transition to complete, where trade, which is destocking by 1 to 3 days time. Where they're having higher price inventories, they will liquidate that. We will then stock of lower price inventory, consumers will end up using their higher price inventory pantry stock at home. They will start experiencing the lower price inventory. And with the lower price inventory, it's also the more volumes that we give it to consumer, and we want them to consume higher volumes and then come back with repeat purchase. Now that transition of 2-3 quarters it is what will end up taking. The absolute amount of volume growth, price, we had already clarified Latika that we see near flat stroke marginal negative price growth for the next couple of quarters if commodities don't change materially compared to where they are. When it comes to volume growth expectations, I think one is be mindful where markets are",
    "Now that transition of 2-3 quarters it is what will end up taking. The absolute amount of volume growth, price, we had already clarified Latika that we see near flat stroke marginal negative price growth for the next couple of quarters if commodities don't change materially compared to where they are. When it comes to volume growth expectations, I think one is be mindful where markets are. The point I mentioned earlier, market grew volume at 5 percentage on the back of a 6% volume decline in same period last year. 2-year market CAGR is near flat. As far as HUL is concerned, we grew our volume by 3% this quarter on the back of 6% growth last year's same quarter. So, we had a 2- year CAGR of 5 percentage. I think hence, if I look at next few quarters, the point of transition, I mentioned, we will have to see volume recovery and consumers habit coming back in terms of more consumption and market growth will, of course, will end up driving the amount of volume growth we are able to do on the base that we have against Page 35 of 36 Sensitivity: Public June Quarter 2023 Earnings call of Hindustan Unilever Limited the market base. Once you add those two elements, you will see how things play out. Now coming to rural, yes, compared to earlier, I did mention that the slowdown has bottomed out. It's on the path of recovery, all right signs in terms of macro level. And the only element which is unknown, and we'll know in the next few months' time, how that plays out is weather. And that's the reason we called out that unknown element. That's the element which we got to wait and watch. But if I take that element out, there are many factors which are helping in our mind, a rural recovery and which is why we did mention that we are optimistic sans the weather concerns. So that's how I'll summarize Latika",

Sorry, we will not be able to guide you to a precise number of volume growth in the next few quarters, but I hope that the narrative helped you to gauge where our minds are at this point in time, the way we see this panning out. A. Ravishankar: Thank you, Ritesh. With that, we will come to an end of the Q&A session.

May please note that in case of any inadvertent error during this live audio call, the transcript will be provided with the corrected information. I would now like to invite our CFO, Mr. Seth. Over to you, sir. Ajay Seth: Thanks Pranav, Good afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen, I hope you and your families are healthy and safe. Let me start with some business highlights during the quarter. Maruti Suzuki celebrated ‘40 years of Suzuki’s partnership with the people of India’. During the event, Hon’ble Prime Minister laid foundation stone of Suzuki Motor Gujarat electric vehicle battery manufacturing facility at Hansalpur, Gujarat and Maruti Suzuki vehicle manufacturing facility in Kharkhoda, Haryana. The Company was incorporated to provide cars for the masses of India and also build a vibrant manufacturing Industry in India. We are happy to share that the Company has been true to its reason for existence even today. If we look back, one of the key success factors in our journey has been the strong focus on understanding and fulfilling the needs of customers by offering them relevant products, technologies, and services. Over the years, customers have evolved and accordingly our products, services, and business processes too have aligned, keeping the customers at the heart of it.

    'MSIL Conference Call Transcript 28th October 2022 2 | P a g e The other factor has been how we have always thought of the long-term in all our actions. All management decisions are based on the long-term interests of our stakeholders. Last but not the least, we have a very good blend of Indian and Japanese culture in our Company. We were able to combine Japanese shop-floor practices and discipline with Indian innovation and zeal in our operations. Our parent Suzuki, Japan, has been a silent support, trying to look at the future from its global experience and carefully selecting the best technology and products for Indian customers. Coming to the recent new model launches, • In September, the Company started retailing its newest flagship offering from NEXA, the Grand Vitara. With over 75,000 bookings in a short span of time, customer response for Grand Vitara is overwhelming. The Grand Vitara is a multi-product offering with cutting-edge Intelligent Electric Hybrid powertrain, Progressive Smart Hybrid technology and Suzuki ALLGRIP SELECT technology is designed to appeal to a varied customer base and will revolutionize the SUV space in India. • In August, the Company launched a full model change of its iconic brand Alto. The All-New Alto K10 is loaded with host of comfort, safety, convenience and connectivity features. • The Company further strengthened its green vehicles’ portfolio by introducing S-CNG powertrain technology in Swift and S-Presso. With this, Maruti Suzuki now offers 10 vehicles with factory-fitted S-CNG technology. Maruti Suzuki’s Research & Development facility conducts rigorous testing for its factory-fitted S-CNG cars to deliver unmatched safety, performance, durability and fuel efficiency. Going forward, the Company will stive to further strengthen its SUV portfolio to dominate the SUV segment, just like all other segments',

Coming to the business environment during the quarter, On the back of better availability of electronic components, the Company reported its highest ever sales volume in any quarter. The electronics component shortages are still limiting our production volumes. In this quarter, the Company could not produce 35,000 vehicles. Limited visibility on availability of electronics components is a challenge in planning our production. Our Supply Chain, Engineering, production and sales teams are working towards maximizing the production volume from available semi-conductors. The supply situation of electronic components continues to remain unpredictable. Coming to the Highlights of Q2 (July-September), FY 2022-23 The Company sold a total of 517,395 vehicles during the quarter. Sales in the domestic market stood at 454,200 units. Exports were at 63,195 units. The same period previous year was marked MSIL Conference Call Transcript 28th October 2022 3 | P a g e by acute shortage of electronic components and consequently the Company could sell a total of 379,541 units comprising 320,133 units in domestic and 59,408 units in export markets. Pending customer orders stood at about 412,000 vehicles at the end of this quarter out of which about 130,000 vehicle pre-bookings are for recently launched models.

    'Pending customer orders stood at about 412,000 vehicles at the end of this quarter out of which about 130,000 vehicle pre-bookings are for recently launched models. During the quarter, the Company registered its highest-ever quarterly Net Sales of INR 285,435 million. During the same period previous year, the Net Sales were at INR 192,978 million. The Operating Profit in quarter 2 FY2022-23 stood at INR 20,463 million as against INR 988 million in quarter 2 FY2021-22. The Operating Profit in Q2 of last year had dipped sharply owing to steep commodity price increases and electronic component supply constraints and hence results of Q2 FY2022-23 are not strictly comparable with those of Q2 FY2021-22. The Company has been making simultaneous efforts in securing electronic components availability, cost reduction and improving realization from the market to better its margins. With this, the Net Profit for the quarter rose to INR 20,615 million from INR 4,753 million in Q2 FY2021-22. Coming to the Highlights of H1 (April-September), FY 2022-23 The Company sold a total of 985,326 units during the period. Sales in the domestic market stood at 852,694 units. Exports in this half year were at 132,632 units. During the same period previous year which is H1 FY2021-22, the Company registered a total sale of 733,155 units including 628,228 units in domestic market and 104,927 units in the export market. In addition to electronic components shortage, the sales in H1 FY2021-22 were also severely affected due to COVID related disruptions and hence results of H1 FY2022-23 cannot be compared with those of H1 FY2021-22. The Company registered Net Sales of INR 538,298 million in H1 FY2022-23, which is the highest-ever half-yearly Net Sales. The Net Sales in H1 FY2021-22 were at INR 360,965 million.

We are now ready to take your questions, feedback and any other observations that you may have. Thank you. Moderator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question and answer session. We have the first question from the line of Kumar Rakesh from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Kumar Rakesh: My first question was around realization. So, sequentially, we have seen an increase in the realization by about 2%. Now, this is quite noteworthy given that in the context of the volume mix which we had during the quarter, mini and compact segments mix had increased while UVs MSIL Conference Call Transcript 28th October 2022 4 | P a g e and export mix or the volume mix was lower. And also discounting in September quarter usually is higher than what happens in the June quarter. So, despite all of this, we have seen an increase in realization. So, can you please help us understand that what led to this realization increase? Ajay Seth: Sequentially, there is an improvement in realization and this is attributed to again the mix because while we had lauched the new Alto, the price point of the old Alto and new Alto were different. So, that's one part. Second also, I think the proportion of the Brezza and other high- end vehicles were higher compared to the first quarter, which led to this higher realization. Also the fact that we had taken a price increase in the first quarter, which was partial in first quarter and fully absorbed in the second quarter. So, that also had its impact. Discounts are more or less same in the 2 quarters. It’s marginally higher in this quarter compared to first quarter, not very different",

Discounts are more or less same in the 2 quarters. It’s marginally higher in this quarter compared to first quarter, not very different. Kumar Rakesh: My second question was how to look at now at the installed capacity that we have access to at Maruti given that we’ll also have access to Toyota’s capacity, so what number we should be looking at the installed capacity for us? Rahul Bharti: So, as of now, we have about 22.5 lakh capacity at Haryana plus Gujarat. Of course, production at Karnataka is over and above this. And in times to come, we are in process of working on the Kharkhoda plant, which will be up and running in the year 2025. And if required, I think most likely we might have to add about 1 lakh capacity on a short term basis in Manesar to meet intermediate demand. Manesar 1 lakh might come by April ’24 and Kharkhoda in the subsequent year. Moderator: We have our next question from the line of Pramod Kumar from UBS. Please go ahead. Pramod Kumar: And just on the opening comments, you talked about future SUV launches to dominate the segment, like how you dominate the other categories, which is quite heartening because your current SUV market share, SUV plus MPV market share is 17 percentage points. So, if you can just help us understand between you or Rahul san as to what are the plans here because the understanding is that it's a pretty competitive segment with very well entrenched models and Maruti is kind of coming late in the category",
    "So, if you can just help us understand between you or Rahul san as to what are the plans here because the understanding is that it's a pretty competitive segment with very well entrenched models and Maruti is kind of coming late in the category. You're talking about dominance, but even if it's significant market share what are plans and how do you get there, sir? Ajay Seth: So, Pramod, I think let the excitement carry on some more time because we have said that we are commited to address this SUV segment. And therefore, we have mentioned that there will be more launches in these segments. But as you're aware that we don't give any details of the products, product plans and as such, there should be some excitement which will be visible to you as you saw in Grand Vitara, maybe soon you will see more excitement in the newer launches that we will have. But definitely, we are committed to the SUV segment, which will not only help us address the growing segment but also help us address the market share loss that we've had in the past. MSIL Conference Call Transcript 28th October 2022 5 | P a g e Pramod Kumar: And then sir, just related to this, generally the automotive thumb rule is that the pricing of a product goes higher, the profitability is generally better, of course, subject to scale. And SUVs are significantly more pricier than comparable products in every category. So, is that understanding right that as you make this pivot from a hatchback less portfolio to a higher price SUV segment, there is no reason why you should be kind of compromising your profitability, right, when you make the switch and transition. Ajay Seth: See, profitability is all dependent on what is your ability of pricing a product at a given point in time. And in the past with portfolio being the smaller cars and we were not present in the SUV segment, still our profitability was reasonably good",
    "Ajay Seth: See, profitability is all dependent on what is your ability of pricing a product at a given point in time. And in the past with portfolio being the smaller cars and we were not present in the SUV segment, still our profitability was reasonably good. I think it'll be a combination of what the market can absorb, where you can price your product and also, when the product matures over a period and as you localize and cost goes down, things change in that interim period. So, it will be a combination of many factors. So, giving an answer to that would be very complicated at this point in time. Pramod Kumar: Sir, and the last question then is on the financial, on the expenditure side, we have seen that it kind of outpaced the revenue growth, quarter-on-quarter, other expenditures, revenue growth. So, what is driving that sir, and if you can just throw more light on the sustainable number there, and even your employee expense has seen a reasonable jump. So, if you can just help us understand these 2 better, sir. Ajay Seth: So, in sequential, one thing that's built in and this is also other expenses is royalty. And with the volume going up, the royalty also as an absolute value goes up. And so there is an impact of that which is increased from Q1 to Q2, that's about INR 150 crore. Then there is increase in the advertisement and marketing costs. And as you are aware that we’ve had launches, and also we mentioned in the previous call as well that we will not be shying away from investing in marketing spend because that gives us a much longer visibility. So, that's gone up by another INR 150 crore. And also the manufacturing expenses have gone up because of the significant rise in the energy prices, the power and fuel costs have significantly gone up. Also, certain activities that we were scaling down earlier, and in a normal situation, we've restarted that. So, there's an increase on that account as well. So, these are broadly the heads where it's gone up",
    "So, that's gone up by another INR 150 crore. And also the manufacturing expenses have gone up because of the significant rise in the energy prices, the power and fuel costs have significantly gone up. Also, certain activities that we were scaling down earlier, and in a normal situation, we've restarted that. So, there's an increase on that account as well. So, these are broadly the heads where it's gone up. There is a small increase in other heads, including the employee costs, which is a normal increase that you have on account of the normal increments, etc, that happens during the year. But other than that, I think there is no other factor of increase at this point in time. Pramod Kumar: And would you expect the marketing intensity to continue like this? Or you would expect some bit of normalization or even on the royalty side, is there any launch related royalty pay off one- off when a new model is introduced? Ajay Seth: No. So, there is no launch related royalty that we pay. Royalty is basically linked to sales. And it will be based on the same formula that we have mentioned to you in the past. So, there will be no change as far as that is concerned. Marketing spend will depend on many factors. There is a kind of visibility that we need for the new models, the kind of visibility that we need for existing MSIL Conference Call Transcript 28th October 2022 6 | P a g e brands and existing models. And also, as you're aware, we mentioned that we'll be bringing in more new models, so obviously the spend will remain stepped up. Moderator: We have our next question from the line of Amyn Pirani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Amyn Pirani: Sir, just to go back to the question on discounts and royalty, can you mention the discount per vehicle number as well as the royalty number for the quarter? I know you answered the question directionally, but can you give us the numbers also",

Amyn Pirani: Sir, just to go back to the question on discounts and royalty, can you mention the discount per vehicle number as well as the royalty number for the quarter? I know you answered the question directionally, but can you give us the numbers also. Ajay Seth: So, discounts in this quarter were at INR 13,840 per vehicle, and they were at INR 12,748 in the first quarter. So, they are about INR 1,000 higher than the first quarter. They were obviously much higher in the second quarter of last year. They were at about INR 18,500 in the second quarter of last year. So, that was on discount. The royalty percentage last year was at 3.5%, now it is at 3.8%. And the first quarter royalty was slightly lower than this which was between 3.6% and 3.7%. Amyn Pirani: And secondly, on your CapEx, I see that in your cash flow, I think you've already spent I think INR 3,500 crore on CapEx for the first half. So, can you help us understand what's the full year expectation number and what are the areas in which these spends are going? Is most of it going towards the Haryana CapEx? Or is there some other areas where you're spending this money? Ajay Seth: So, we will be spending upwards of INR 7,000 crore this year. And this includes of course, the Kharkhoda facilities where now we've started our construction work. And also we’ll have to place orders to various vendors. So, that will be one major portion of CapEx. Besides that, all the new model launches that we are doing where we have to have the investment on toolings, et cetera, I think that will be another large piece of CapEx. So, these are two areas where the CapEx will be maximum",

So, these are two areas where the CapEx will be maximum. Then you have the other routine capital expenditure on the other aspects of the business, which is R&D, the regular maintenance CapEx. So, these are the key areas where we will be spending. Moderator: We have our next question from the line of Raghunandhan from Emkay Global. Please go ahead. Raghunandhan: Firstly, order book is huge at 4.1 lakh as of the end of September and new products are 1.3 lakh for the remaining portion which is large at 2.8 lakh. Can you indicate, which are the major models? Rahul Bharti: So, it's a mix, but mostly we have seen Ertiga has a high waitlist and anecdotally also you keep getting requests for early allotment. Of course, the new models we have discussed, the Baleno also has a high number and then the other models mostly equally spread. Raghunandhan: And CNG will be 130,000, 140,000 units? Rahul Bharti: Approximately Yes. MSIL Conference Call Transcript 28th October 2022 7 | P a g e Raghunandhan: Sir, given the strong response for hybrid, there is a scope for launch of hybrids and other existing model. What are the thoughts here? And typically, what is the timeline required for introducing a new powertrain in existing model? Rahul Bharti: Yes. So, we are also happy that the strong hybrid is getting a good response. In the Grand Vitara, more than 35% of the total bookings that we have today are of the strong hybrid. This may be slightly premature to conclude and so we'll watch this as it comes. And we'll try to look at other options in other models also",

This may be slightly premature to conclude and so we'll watch this as it comes. And we'll try to look at other options in other models also. Raghunandhan: Lastly, the gross margin has improved 150 basis point quarter-on-quarter. So, can you indicate what would be the contribution of GP by depreciations and commodity benefits for Q2? Ajay Seth: So, sequentially, there has been a benefit on account of commodities because commodities have come off. And also the element of normal cost reduction that we do. Even on the exchange rates, we have gained there because the JPY depreciation has been steep during the quarter. So, there are combinations of factors this time now which are all positive. So, one, as I said commodities, second, I mentioned about regular cost reduction that we do and the JPY impact, overall impact of the currency depreciation. So, all put together, you see a combination of these three are impacting the gross margins to improve by what you've seen. Raghunandhan: And how do you see the commodity benefits going forward? Ajay Seth: Commodity benefits going forward is difficult to predict. Certain commodities have cooled off and certain commodities are higher than the earlier period. So, it's a combination. For example, anything related to oil, energy, et cetera is still expensive, where we've been shelling out more money than before. But things like steel and precious metals have shown improvement. Now, we will have to wait and watch in terms of how the future moves, I think it will at least remain steady in the third quarter. But the indication given by our supply chain is that there could be slight inching up in the fourth quarter",

We have our next question from the line of Chandramouli Muthiah from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Chandramouli Muthiah: And thank you for taking my question. The first question is on the Grand Vitara profitability. Could you maybe share any additional color on how long you think this product could take to reach sort of corporate average EBIT margin? So, from a percentage margin perspective, maybe see scope for this product to reach the corporate average EBIT margin over time or is the outsource manufacturing arrangement likely to sort of continue a shared margin structure with Toyota. Rahul Bharti: So, we do not comment on individual segment or individual product margins as such. But the largest benefit was that it's a premium offering in the SUV space. And what we are excited about is that a fair percentage of the bookings are in the higher variants. And this is both for Grand Vitara and for the Brezza. So, a very good percentage of the bookings are from the upper or the MSIL Conference Call Transcript 28th October 2022 8 | P a g e top variants. So, that is positive. And once we have volumes and we have presence in these segments, profit automatically follows. Chandramouli Muthiah: My second question is on the semiconductor situation. So, despite still a bit of a nagging impact of semiconductor shortages, we seem to have hit sort of record production in volumes this quarter",

So, despite still a bit of a nagging impact of semiconductor shortages, we seem to have hit sort of record production in volumes this quarter. So, just trying to understand the few units that you are not able to produce this quarter, what is the typical model mix there? Is it on more premium vehicles or some CNG vehicles? Any color there will be very helpful. Rahul Bharti: No, it's not like that. It's basically most of the constraint is coming from one electronics part manufacturer and of course, it is in some specific models. So, hopefully, going forward, we hope that the situation eases, though it is very difficult to predict. Chandramouli Muthiah: And lastly, I just have a housekeeping question if you could maybe just give us the numbers on spare sales and export revenues for the quarter. Rahul Bharti: So, export revenue was about INR 3,400 crore for the quarter. And spares, generally, we do not have a separate disclosure. Moderator: We have our next question from the line of Jinesh Gandhi from MOFSL. Please go ahead. Jinesh Gandhi: A couple of questions from my side. First of all, are we seeing any material impact on CNG demand given the substantial price increases which we have seen and how do we see that segment considering the price differential now? Rahul Bharti: So, fortunately, till now, no, but there is a cause of concern, because of the high prices and we have represented to the government on this. But we are informed that in the commercial vehicle space, there has been an impact. So, CNG for us, this quarter was more than 20% penetration",
    'First of all, are we seeing any material impact on CNG demand given the substantial price increases which we have seen and how do we see that segment considering the price differential now? Rahul Bharti: So, fortunately, till now, no, but there is a cause of concern, because of the high prices and we have represented to the government on this. But we are informed that in the commercial vehicle space, there has been an impact. So, CNG for us, this quarter was more than 20% penetration. But we are engaging with the government to rein in the prices because this has nothing to do with Indian cost. It is only linked to a global index, which has a force majeure kind of situation. Jinesh Gandhi: Right. And similarly, are we seeing any impact on the export demand given that many of the end export markets are witnessing challenges on currency and similar macro pressures. So, obviously pressure in demand and this thing. Rahul Bharti: So, fortunately, nothing so far. But we are watching the situation. Jinesh Gandhi: And can you share retail sales in the current quarter and volumes in Gujarat? Rahul Bharti: Actually, this is a continuous period starting from the first Navratra till end of December. Some models are in transit, some we have stocked up for some particular orders. but we are expecting that by end of December we’ll be able to sell a lot of models and keep our closing stock low. Jinesh Gandhi: Sir, my question was retail sales for 2Q FY ’23. MSIL Conference Call Transcript 28th October 2022 9 | P a g e Rahul Bharti: Yes. Because part of it was in the festive period, so that’s what. So, it is better to club till end of December which means club it till Q3. Then have a view. Jinesh Gandhi: And Gujarat production, would that be around that similar 31%-32% range or has gone up? Rahul Bharti: About 31%. We did about 162,000 units from Gujarat, SMG. Moderator: We have our next question from the line of Pramod Amthe from InCred Capital. Please go ahead',

Moderator: We have our next question from the line of Pramod Amthe from InCred Capital. Please go ahead. Pramod Amthe: Continuing on that CNG question, how has the mix of fleet versus personal bias changed in last 2 years? Can you give some color? Rahul Bharti: Fleet versus personal buyers? Pramod Amthe: Yes. Rahul Bharti: We have a very good response from the personal buyers within CNG. But generally what we have seen for example, the Ertiga is a very hot seller. So, that kind of impression that we are getting is that Wagon R and Ertiga, Ertiga is more than I think 2/3rd is CNG. Wagon R also has a high traction. So, the models with a higher boot space, they are going very well on CNG. Pramod Amthe: You mean the commercial is relatively higher in these 2 segments. I was looking for more commercials. Rahul Bharti: No, it is not linked with commercial segment. So, if you have a bigger model and bigger boot space, the CNG acceptance is far higher. Pramod Amthe: The reason why I ask you is that there is some pressure on demand in the commercial segment. Rahul Bharti: I’m so sorry. When I said that I meant trucks. Commercial does not mean taxis. It meant trucks. So, when we discuss within SIAM, the commercial vehicle manufacturer, the trucks, they are concerned about it. Not in passenger vehicles. Pramod Amthe: And what’s the industry for vehicles mix, mix of personal and commercial for industry for the car set for CNG. Pramod Amthe: Yes. sorry. I was saying for car industry, CNG segment, what’s the mix of fleet and personal? Rahul Bharti: I’ll have to get back with the figure, not readily available',
    'Commercial does not mean taxis. It meant trucks. So, when we discuss within SIAM, the commercial vehicle manufacturer, the trucks, they are concerned about it. Not in passenger vehicles.

I was saying for car industry, CNG segment, what’s the mix of fleet and personal? Rahul Bharti: I’ll have to get back with the figure, not readily available. But there’s a fair amount of spread across all models, and even for example in models like Wagon R, we have a good level of penetration and Ertiga has very high level of penetration. Dzire Tour are obviously because in many places, it is mandated that they need to run on CNG, so we have 88% penetration. Even the normal Dzire has about 35% penetration, the non-taxi Dzire. MSIL Conference Call Transcript 28th October 2022 10 | P a g e Pramod Amthe: Second one is with regard to the strong hybrid which you have launched. Can you give more details in terms of your cell or battery sourcing. What’s the type of localization you have in that and sustenance of the current pricing, do you have more visibility on that considering that rupee has depreciated and local content versus important content in those cells or battery? Rahul Bharti: See, pricing is always dynamic. We keep watching the market, it’s a new product. And of course, we are very consumer centric. So, we’ll keep taking a view on the market on a regular basis. As you rightly mentioned the factors can change and if we get any kind of cost reduction along the way normally, we do consider it. Pramod Amthe: And any indication on localization there current and how you look at going forward, the cell? Rahul Bharti: So, it is being manufactured at in Karnataka. So, the local content will also depend on our OEM partner. Moderator: We have our next question from the line of Kapil Singh from Nomura. Please go ahead',

So, the local content will also depend on our OEM partner. Moderator: We have our next question from the line of Kapil Singh from Nomura. Please go ahead. Kapil Singh: Firstly, I just wanted to check on overall growth, what you are expecting for the full year and given the situation and supply constraints, do you expect Maruti to do better than industry in this financial year? Rahul Bharti: So, of course, your answer is linked to the supply of semiconductors. So, given whatever we get we should be able to produce and send to the market. Industry is expected to do about 3.8 million this year. Kapil Singh: The question was just trying to understand that order book is pretty high but the production has not matched the order book. So, if you could just help us understand why that is happening? Inventory has also increased. So, what is the technical issue here that we are facing? Rahul Bharti: See, in the festive months, we do stock Besides, given the total semiconductor supplies, you can maximize your production if you keep a slightly longer term view. So, we are keeping a view till let’s say end of December by which time we should be able to get both wholesales and retails at a higher level given the overall semiconductor constraints. The idea is to maximize within the constraint available if we improve the timeframe a bitt. Kapil Singh: And secondly I just wanted to check given your experience with strong hybrid and the kind of demand you are seeing, are you looking to add more models with strong hybrid option? Rahul Bharti: Slightly premature. Yes, obviously over a longer period of time, that would be the intent',

Kapil Singh: And secondly I just wanted to check given your experience with strong hybrid and the kind of demand you are seeing, are you looking to add more models with strong hybrid option? Rahul Bharti: Slightly premature. Yes, obviously over a longer period of time, that would be the intent. But we will get more feedback from the consumer and from our manufacturing experience, obviously, the efforts will be in that direction. And because it helps majorly in CO2 reduction also, so nothing that we can immediately offer to comment on, nothing specific, but that would be the direction in the future. Moderator: We have our next question from the line of Arvind Sharma from Citi. Please go ahead. MSIL Conference Call Transcript 28th October 2022 11 | P a g e Arvind Sharma: Sir, first question would be on the capacity expansion. You did mention something like a lakh at Manesar and further at the new plant. Is it possible to share some timeline about the net capacity expansion, especially in the new plant, how much will it add? I believe it would be in lieu of something which will go away at Gurgaon. So, what will be the net capacity addition at the new plant? Rahul Bharti: We are not looking at any kind of reduction in Gurgaon, in fact, at least in the shorter term, we might have to increase production in Gurgaon. Kharkhoda plant, all plants, generally there the optimum economic size is about 2.5 lakh per annum. Our first plant should be commissioned by the first quarter of calendar ’25. And I think we already have to start thinking on the second plant if demand growth continues in India. we are not looking at any kind of reduction in Gurgaon. Arvind Sharma: This 2.5 lakh would be in addition to current and add to it 1 lakh at Manesar, right? Rahul Bharti: Yes',

Arvind Sharma: This 2.5 lakh would be in addition to current and add to it 1 lakh at Manesar, right? Rahul Bharti: Yes. Arvind Sharma: Sir, second question more for the current quarter, what are the FX gains? Is it possible to quantify the FX gains and where do they reflect? And also as corollary, what is the import content both for your production in Gujarat and Haryana? What are the import content for these 2 plants in these 2 locations and the FX gains this quarter? Ajay Seth: Import content for both the plants would be similar. There is no difference because all the procurement is more or less on the same basis. So, our total direct import content is about 4%. So, it will fall in that category only both the plants. Similarly, I think the other thing is the indirect import content which also would be in a similar category because the vendors are common and the material that we have buying from the vendors are basically similar vendors. So, there is no difference in terms of import content. In terms of forex, so between different currencies, there have been gains. Largely on the import and export side, on the dollar-rupee exposure, we are naturally hedged. So, we use a natural hedge route. On the dollar-yen, there have been maximum gains in this quarter compared to last quarter and also last year because of the significant depreciation of the currency. And the net impact of exchange rate, have been about INR 158 crore of gain in this quarter compared to first quarter of this year. Arvind Sharma: This is the entire gain on the P&L, INR 158 crore? Ajay Seth: That’s right. And they will be under different heads',

Ajay Seth: Between 10% and 11%. Moderator: We have our next question from the line of Chirag Shah from Edelweiss. Please go ahead. MSIL Conference Call Transcript 28th October 2022 12 | P a g e Chirag Shah: Sir, one very specific question on the SUV strategy. are you looking to enter the compact car category because some of your peers for example Tata Punch are trying to address that category with a SUV type or SUV feel model. is there a part of your strategy the SUV launches that you’re indicating? And if you can elaborate on it, it would be helpful. Rahul Bharti: Sorry, you mentioned SUV or XEV? Chirag Shah: SUV type of a product like Tata Punch, is a compact SUV, addressing that Baleno kind of a range in terms of price point. Rahul Bharti: So, as Mr. Seth mentioned some time ago, let’s keep the excitement and let’s bring our products which deliver pleasant surprises to the customers. So, you’ll have to wait for sometime. Chirag Shah: And sir, second questions was on the strong hybrid, is there any restriction or technological limitation on the size of the vehicle to add strong hybrids? How much lower you can go in terms of technology today, in terms of price of the vehicle? Rahul Bharti: So, you are right. Strong hybrids at the moment we have solutions in slightly bigger cars which have room and the engine room to accommodate both the powetrains',

Strong hybrids at the moment we have solutions in slightly bigger cars which have room and the engine room to accommodate both the powetrains. It becomes a bit of a challenge to bring them in smaller cars. But that is what Suzuki’s competence is all about. So, we’ll watch the market and to reduce carbon we have to adopt a portfolio of technologies and each technology, each model will have its own context, its cost, its volume. So, it’s a complex equation that we keep working on all the time. we’ll keep watching how we can maximize hybrid volumes in the future. Moderator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. And with this we conclude today’s conference call. On behalf of Maruti Suzuki India Limited, we thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect your lines. Ajay Seth: Thank you. Rahul Bharti: Thank you.

So, I would request all of you to raise the some of the concerns or the issues what you believe is very important for the investors and analysts. With that let me just say a few things on this. So let me welcome to all of you on this 19th Annual Analysts and Investors Meet. We had been consistently doing this in end of July or beginning of August and break was during the COVID period. Fortunately, it is behind us, nobody is talking about that, and we all are back. I hope that everybody is healthy and happy and we are looking at something, which is now the growth trajectory and as you will also would have seen the financial year 22-23 has witnessed a very unprecedented growth and there was some kind of uncertainties, which was encountered specifically on the fuel side worldwide and you will be knowing that many countries including Europe and I don't even talk about our neighbors, they have gone through a very tough time but we as country has managed the energy quite well and in that context, the credit goes to the government. Your Company has played a very, very vital role in this time of very kind of unprecedented increase suddenly after this pent-up demand, which was coming from the post-COVID. The good point is that we are still maintaining and this month also, it is almost around close to double digit growth, which is a very, very kind of promising thing. I think, this is going to be really providing enough opportunities for the growth",

I think, this is going to be really providing enough opportunities for the growth. Page 2 of 23 NTPC Limited July 31, 2023 Our diligent project management strategies and the operational efficiency, contributed to the healthy EPS, which registered a growth of approximately 5.6% over the previous year. We have been carefully monitoring the situation and taking corrective actions continuously to ensure the energy security for the country by ensuring reliable fuel supply and this will be coming from our captive mines or sourcing the coal from other sources. Currently all our coal stations have sufficient stock. We have more than 16 days stock and due to the diligent monitoring of the situation, none of our stations were starved because of the coal in the last year. Our stock has been performing quite well and it has hit 52 weeks high, and you people can tell far better than probably anybody else. For FY 22-23, the Board of Directors have recommended a final dividend of Rs.3 per share, subject to the approval of our shareholders at the upcoming AGM, this final dividend is in addition to the interim dividend already paid at Rs.4.25 per share. So, put together it will become Rs.7.25 per share. This year marks the 30th consecutive year of dividend distribution showcasing our steadfast commitment to providing value to our esteemed shareholders. Regarding NTPC performance and the way forward, there will be detailed presentation as I just mentioned. But let me add, as I said earlier, a few points. We have fast-tracked our energy transition plans and made significant progress on the renewables',

We have fast-tracked our energy transition plans and made significant progress on the renewables. There may be some kind of questions, which keep coming that, how much we are going to add this year, how much we are going to add next year, and we have the CEO of our NTPC Green Energy Limited, Mr. Mohit Bhargava, who is present here. So maybe, we will give a chance to him if it is required and some of the questions are coming that straightway can be addressed. And let me assure you that the progress is very, very promising. We will get into that detail. I am happy to inform you that for the first time our organic non-fossil capacity addition has surpassed the fossil capacity addition, showcasing our commendable progress in the energy transition journey. We have also finalized several new renewable and storage contracts and as a result, our total renewable pipeline has reached 20 GW. Additionally, we have made several new partnerships in the renewable segment including the C&I consumers and that is going to be not a very small 5 MW, 10 MW, it is going to be on a gigawatt scale. We take great pleasure in sharing our continuous success in securing the renewable bids, cementing our position as a formidable player in the India's renewable market. In the Financial year 22-23, we have achieved the capacity addition of 3,292 MW with a commercial capacity addition of 3,952 MW including the acquisition of Jhabua, which was 600 MW. This included significant contribution of 1,352 MW from the renewable sources and the first ever overseas capacity of 660 MW in Bangladesh",
    "We take great pleasure in sharing our continuous success in securing the renewable bids, cementing our position as a formidable player in the India's renewable market. In the Financial year 22-23, we have achieved the capacity addition of 3,292 MW with a commercial capacity addition of 3,952 MW including the acquisition of Jhabua, which was 600 MW. This included significant contribution of 1,352 MW from the renewable sources and the first ever overseas capacity of 660 MW in Bangladesh. Further, we have added 770 MW in this quarter, Q1 FY24, elevating the NTPC group’s total installed capacity to 73,024 MW. We are declaring the commercial operation of Barh Unit-2, 660 MW from midnight today. As you will be knowing, that Barh was something where we had to terminate the contract in between and we had to really take the kind of Make in India and our own engineers have Page 3 of 23 NTPC Limited July 31, 2023 contributed to commission these units. So, the first unit is running successfully, second unit is getting commercial operation and the next one is going to be next year. We have recorded an all-time high-power generation of 399 billion units, that means in a closing distance from 400 billion units, registering a growth of 11%. Further, eight of our coal stations figured in the top 25 best performing stations of the country in terms of the PLF and our coal- based station registered a PLF of around 75% against the country's 64%. Let me take a second here and try to clarify, I have no hesitation to respond afterwards also, but going forward let us not harp on the PLF. PLF is not that important as the availability and the reliability is, because the PLF is something, which was the barometer for the shortage situation. The most important is that the power should be available on demand. So, during the daytime when the solar is going to be in plenty, most of the power stations will be getting back down, which is going to be a good thing",
    'PLF is not that important as the availability and the reliability is, because the PLF is something, which was the barometer for the shortage situation. The most important is that the power should be available on demand. So, during the daytime when the solar is going to be in plenty, most of the power stations will be getting back down, which is going to be a good thing. And we would also like to do that because of our blending policy of the Ministry of Power, so that we can also reduce our emissions in that. So, I just took this opportunity to explain that the PLF should not be the only criteria. The availability and the reliability are much more important in this. These numbers demonstrate our best-in-class asset management practices and capability of human resources, and we are completing almost 40 years for the first unit of Korba unit now. We have already completed almost 42 years for Singrauli. We are completing almost around 40 years, and these are operating at about 100% PLF anyway. We have successfully commissioned a blending project that incorporates the green hydrogen with PNG, piped natural gas. Further, the green hydrogen mobility in Leh and Delhi are slated to be commissioned in the current financial year. Just to let you know that this green hydrogen which is blended with the PNG is coming from the floating solar plant in Kawas. So, it is completely different. The floating solar plant is feeding the electrolyser to produce the hydrogen and that hydrogen is being blended. So that may be a very, very small, tiny kind of experiment but that will pave way for a lot of opportunities going forward. On the Leh-Ladakh, we were very close to have the commissioning or rather starting the operation of our hydrogen powered bus for the mobility, but floods have caused some problems in the transportation. So maybe, it will take another 15-20 days though the bus is going to be delivered on 10th of August',

So maybe, it will take another 15-20 days though the bus is going to be delivered on 10th of August. Another important highlight is the exceptional growth in the coal production. So, one way is that what we are talking about this transition and mobility. On the other side, this fuel security is the coal production from captive mines, which reached 23.2 million tons during FY 22-23 making a growth of 65%. Further, the Q1 of the current financial year, we have registered a growth of 100% in the coal production as compared to previous financial year. So that is quite reassuring on the fuel security side that we are putting all efforts. We have set an ambitious coal production target of 34 million tons in this current financial year. Our bill realization of the financial year 22-23 reached Rs.1,54,356 crore and no doubt that, we have achieved the 100% realization on that. Page 4 of 23 NTPC Limited July 31, 2023 We have demonstrated MSW to green charcoal plant at Banaras and now we are taking in Noida and Bhopal and Hubli and maybe, that will be another one which will be for those who had the keen interest in the ESG that it is not only for our Company, but we are trying to help the society as a whole and the country in this aspect. So, coming to ESG, we are diligently following ESG principles, timely responding to any ESG related queries by all investors and the ESG rating analysis. We also regularly update our website with the ESG related disclosures. We are consistently expanding our scope by incorporating additional sustainability standards and the ESG frameworks',
    'So, coming to ESG, we are diligently following ESG principles, timely responding to any ESG related queries by all investors and the ESG rating analysis. We also regularly update our website with the ESG related disclosures. We are consistently expanding our scope by incorporating additional sustainability standards and the ESG frameworks. I am happy to share with you that, our ESG rating by Sustainalytics has improved by one band in the last fiscal. In financial year 22-23, we achieved a specific water consumption of 2.69 litre per kilowatt hour, which is a very good improvement. Additionally, the commencement of our first air-cooled condenser at North Karanpura plant is expected to save around 75% of the water compared to the conventional water-cooled condenser. Our ash utilization percentage has increased to 83% in financial year 22-23, reflecting our commitment to the sustainable waste management practices. We have also embraced the principle of life, lifestyle for environment, as promoted by our country on a global scale and have implemented numerous campaigns and the awareness program across our business units. On the CSR fronts, we have spent approximately Rs.353 crore on the CSR activities and we have another flagship project in this called Girl Empowerment Mission, where we bring the young girls, they are our guests at our townships for a month and that is a life-changing experience for all of them. Almost around 2,000 to 2,500 girls every year, we are able to help them in their life journey. We are actively pursuing the just transition and prioritizing the re-skilling of the workforce and ensuring that, the transition to the clean energy is accompanied by the opportunities for the career development, safeguarding the livelihood of all stakeholders. We recognize the importance of upholding the trust and the confidence placed in us by our stakeholders',

And we will try to see that if we can really move up on that. Accordingly, we have set ambitious target for the capacity addition to the tune of 6 GW in the fiscal year 23-24. As informed last year, while putting utmost thrust on the renewable capacity addition, we are also considering the construction of 7 GW of additional coal-based capacity as Brownfield projects. The commissioning of these capacities is planned in a phased manner with the target time frame set till 2030. As you will be knowing that we had already started the work on Talcher last year. This year we are going to start in Lara and further we will be working on Sipat. Our focus is on completing existing projects, fast-tracking new ones, and operating our fleet efficiently and reliably. As all remaining projects are either pithead or situated on the mine, with the commissioning of these projects our generation share shall see a further rise. Simultaneously, we are adding renewable capacity aggressively and exploring the opportunities in the green hydrogen, on the nuclear front, on the small modular reactors, green charcoal, carbon capture and utilization, green chemicals. Green chemical is basically the project what is going on at present and in it we will capture the carbon dioxide from the stack and utilizing the green hydrogen and making the green methanol. We are also working on the PMC contracts through the International Solar Alliance. Additionally, two nuclear power projects namely Chutka and Mahi Banswara through ASHVINI, a joint venture between NTPC and NPCIL with an aggregate capacity of 4,200 MW are being considered for implementation',

We have taken proactive and successful initiatives to ensure fuel security for our current as well as future capacity requirements. Aggregation of annual contracted quantity on CIL subsidiary level basis has resulted in several benefits such as optimum utilization of coal, avoidance of fixed charges loss and efficient outage planning and stock management. We have signed long-term fuel supply agreements with both CIL and Singareni Collieries Company Limited for reliable supply of coal. We also source coal through bridge linkages, captive mines and e-auctions, further diversifying our sources of coal procurement. To address any shortage of domestic coal, NTPC has imported 15 million metric tons of coal during financial year 23, ensuring an uninterrupted and sufficient coal supply to meet our energy demands. Our consistent focus on being the low-cost power producer has enabled us to maintain a high merit order for our power plants. This advantageous position translates to better PLF and operational efficiency, ensuring that our power plant remains competitive and operate at optimal level. Although, as CMD sir was mentioning, PLF will be of less significance, whereas availability factor or the declared capacity will be the better hallmark or pointer of efficiency going ahead",

Although, as CMD sir was mentioning, PLF will be of less significance, whereas availability factor or the declared capacity will be the better hallmark or pointer of efficiency going ahead. The company's elaborate payment security mechanism has proven highly effective in managing the receivables and ensuring timely and reliable payments from customer, thereby achieving highest ever realization of more than Rs.1.54 lakh crore during financial year 23. Furthermore, the fact that our trade receivables are back at pre-COVID levels indicates the company's resilience and ability to manage financial changes effectively even in face of adverse circumstances. Coming on to NTPC’s HR Vision, our Company has “People First” approach towards employees. We believe in continuous development of our employees through objective and open Page 12 of 23 NTPC Limited July 31, 2023 performance management system. We provide comprehensive training to familiarize our employee with technological advances and up to date operational and management practices. Our key employee performance metrics like sales per employee, value-added per employee, profit per employee and man megawatt ratio has shown consistent improvement. NTPC continues to win all round laurels in various fields in operational, quality, HR, CSR, safety, etc. We are proud of building a high trust, high performance culture.

Turning to financials, as can be seen from the results projected on the screen, NTPC's financial performance has been remarkable, exhibiting sustained revenue growth and robust profits level over the years. In financial year 23, the company achieved its highest ever profit of Rs.17,197 crore, showcasing our strong financial management and operational efficiency. The momentum has continued in financial year 24. The company posted strong financial results for Q1FY24. The profit after tax for Q1 stood at Rs.4,066 crore, reflecting a substantial 9% growth compared to the Q1 of the last year. This financial achievement underscores our ability to adapt to changing market conditions, maintain operational excellence and leveraging our diverse portfolio of power generation assets to sustain growth. Our consolidated financials have exhibited consistent growth driven by strategic investments in value, accretive joint ventures and subsidiaries. The company's performance in FY23 saw significant growth in dividends from JVs and subsidiaries with a remarkable increase of 35% year-on-year. This indicates the success of our investment in these ventures which have contributed to the company's overall financial strength and performance. The NTPC Group's EBITDA also experienced a double digit-growth crossing the notable milestone of Rs.50,000 crore in financial year 23. This substantial EBITDA growth signifies our ability to generate strong operational earnings and manage our financials efficiently. With a proactive approach to investment, operational excellence and a strong financial foundation, we are well positioned to leverage our opportunities in power sector and other related domains, ensuring continued growth and value creation for our stakeholders",
    "50,000 crore in financial year 23. This substantial EBITDA growth signifies our ability to generate strong operational earnings and manage our financials efficiently. With a proactive approach to investment, operational excellence and a strong financial foundation, we are well positioned to leverage our opportunities in power sector and other related domains, ensuring continued growth and value creation for our stakeholders. Our balance sheet size has been growing bigger and stronger demonstrating the company's financial strength and stability. Over the last three years our gross fixed assets have increased by an impressive 43% to Rs.3,38,436 crore showcasing NTPC's commitment to expanding power generation capacity and infrastructure. Concurrently, the capital work-in-progress has decreased by 9% to Rs.89,133 crore, which signifies a successful effort in unlocking capital and turnover of investment into completed assets. Looking ahead, we anticipate continued growth. The turnaround from CWIP to completed assets is expected to be expedited further, particularly with a greater mix of renewable energy projects in the pipeline. Our ability to raise debt at competitive rates from the market enhances our financial flexibility and capacity to fund our expansion plans effectively. With strong financials, NTPC has consistently paid dividends to our shareholders for the past 30 years. The company maintains a dividend policy that balances dividend payouts with the deployment of funds for future growth initiatives. In conclusion, as the leading power generation company, we are well positioned to drive India's energy transition and contribute significantly to the nation's growth and development. Thank you all of you for your attention and patience too. I now hand over to Aditya Dar for further proceedings. Page 13 of 23 NTPC Limited July 31, 2023 ED (Finance): Thank you sir.

    "In conclusion, as the leading power generation company, we are well positioned to drive India's energy transition and contribute significantly to the nation's growth and development. Thank you all of you for your attention and patience too. I now hand over to Aditya Dar for further proceedings. Page 13 of 23 NTPC Limited July 31, 2023 ED (Finance): Thank you sir. We will now have an interaction with our Board. Atul Tiwari: Yes, sir. I am Atul Tiwari from Citi Research. Just two questions. Sir, do you think that over the next four-five years, India will have peak power deficit again, given the dynamics in the sector today? And if that happens, will that increase the opportunity set for NTPC to set up more coal- based plants beyond the 7.2 GW that you have planned? That is my first question. I have one more. Okay, so let me ask the second one. So, you did refer to IPO of the green energy company. So, should we conclude that the strategic investor induction is off the table and now IPO is the only plan or are you exploring both these alternatives in parallel? CMD: Okay. Next. Analyst: Hello sir. What is the logic of separating out the coal business into a 100% subsidiary especially when it is entirely captive for us and there are no commercial sales outside the company? That's my question. CMD: Who was that? Just please, okay. Thank you. Analyst: You talked about IPO, and you say, this particular meeting is for stakeholders also. So, what I am looking here, those who hold shares in NTPC, they must get a right in the proportionate to their holding in green IPO. That is my first thing. And second thing, sir, in your speech you said that pump storage helps for renewable. That is absolutely not clear. If you can do that, that will be better. Another thing what I am seeing is here, in my whole career, hydrogen, ammonia, methane, all these are classified as toxic gases. Hydrogen was the most dangerous",
    'So, what I am looking here, those who hold shares in NTPC, they must get a right in the proportionate to their holding in green IPO. That is my first thing. And second thing, sir, in your speech you said that pump storage helps for renewable. That is absolutely not clear. If you can do that, that will be better. Another thing what I am seeing is here, in my whole career, hydrogen, ammonia, methane, all these are classified as toxic gases. Hydrogen was the most dangerous. And how suddenly, during the last five years, all these gases became safe to operate, use, that is not very clear, sir. Another thing, if we talk about saving in water and other things so that we can reduce the cost of the electricity. But at the same time, we are seeing that the demand is increasing. To reduce the demand, how we can say that, how we can use better equipment so that the energy can be saved. So, what I am looking here is BLDC, to what extent we can use BLDC technology, so that, because BLDC technology saves two-third percent of the energy. So, whether it is possible to use to the higher capacity MW, KW rating, something like that. That I would like to know. And another thing, a small question, and one thing, great thing about you is that you have got only 17% capacity, but you meet 25% requirement, so whether it is a fault of others or whether it is your efficiency, that depends. Thank you, sir. CMD: I think you had put multiple questions. Anyway, we will try to respond. Yes, please. Girish Achhipalia: Hi, sir. Girish from Morgan Stanley. Just three questions. One, on award timelines for the coal- based capacity, can you just suggest how this will get ordered in the next few quarters? Second one was this long-term 8 GW on hydro you mentioned THDC plus NEEPCO',

One, on award timelines for the coal- based capacity, can you just suggest how this will get ordered in the next few quarters? Second one was this long-term 8 GW on hydro you mentioned THDC plus NEEPCO. Can you help us like what's the ballpark capex that we should assume and how much time does it normally take and how we should kind of think through in slightly longer term in terms of commissioning of this capacity? Page 14 of 23 NTPC Limited July 31, 2023 And finally, just the data point on C&I, out of the 20 GW right now, what is the portfolio in C&I right now? And are these firm commitments in terms of PPA? Rohit: So, this is Rohit from Antique Stock Broking. Sir, my first question is on that the country is planning 40 GW of solar and 10 GW of wind, so what is the solution from a macro standpoint that you see for evening base load and peak load demand? So, will you think gas based can see a revival or do you think lithium-ion battery could possibly be a solution or pumped hydro storage? What is the unitary economics that you have in mind which will be feasible? That's question number one. Two is to do with the SMRs, the modular reactor part. What is the capital outlay that you are planning on the nuclear front? Is there any concrete plan as such you have had in mind? Thank you. Analyst: Two questions. First is on the IPO. Do you have any target in mind which you want to achieve in terms of scale and size? Any MW term, and EBITDA terms? When you look for the IPO, is it FY24 or FY25 phenomena when you want to start the process? Sir, my second question is on the renewable side, the capital cost, and the cost of capital, both are equally important",

When you look for the IPO, is it FY24 or FY25 phenomena when you want to start the process? Sir, my second question is on the renewable side, the capital cost, and the cost of capital, both are equally important. So how are you going about ensuring that you are able to produce renewable energy at the lowest cost of capital in comparison with the private IPPs. My third question is on the NEP, the government is, so CEA has started targeting 27 GW of PSP, 47 GW of battery and 25 GW thermal. The cumulative number for the investment is Rs.3 trillion, right? And we are targeting only 60 GW. The numbers seem to be on the lower side. CMD: No, I mean it that you are thinking that this is on the lower side, so we are also a conservative company. So, we are trying to give the conservative figures. So, you can expect a little higher than that. Okay, let me try to attempt a few of the questions. Manish Bhandari: I have a question here. CMD: Yes, please go ahead. Manish Bhandari: Manish Bhandari from Vallum Capital. So, my question is related to the grid imbalance which has happened in many parts of the world because of different sources of energy getting pulled into the grid. So, is your renewed interest in the coal is because of the likelihood of the grid imbalance and this will be a thrust area, the revival of the coal by NTPC will be the thrust area? And maybe some more direction you can put on the grid imbalance, which is likely to come and which I've seen happening in China also? Thank you. Analyst: Sir, my question is we are planning a capex of or 3.3 GW of renewable capacity going to 60 GW by 2032",

Analyst: Sir, my question is we are planning a capex of or 3.3 GW of renewable capacity going to 60 GW by 2032. So, what is the cumulative capex that we have in mind from FY24 to FY32 in the renewable side? What I am interested in is the amount of money that we will spend over the next 8 to 10 years on the renewable side and what is the IRR that we have built in for this capex? Thank you. Page 15 of 23 NTPC Limited July 31, 2023 Analyst: Yes, sir. Sir, one question. The government and regulator wanted to implement this market- based economic dispatch from April 2022 with the NTPC's power projects as the first phase. So, what is the status there? When is it likely to be implemented? Thanks. CMD: Yes, please. You are the last? Okay, go ahead. Analyst: Sir, many years back I was in the BASF plant in Germany. They have a central dome like structure which they call an incinerator. So, the solid, liquid and gaseous wastes from all the 29 plants of BASF were sent into the incinerator. Will the usage of incinerator for emissions be helpful cost wise? Thank you. CMD: No. Atul Mehra: Sir, just one other question on NTPC Green IPO, just at the back. CMD: Who is that? Atul Mehra: Atul Mehra from Motilal Oswal Asset Management, sir. Would you be considering a full- fledged demerger of the business of NTPC Green, or it will continue to remain substantially held by NTPC Limited and there will be some minority which will be offloaded in the IPO? So what is the thought process about the IPO per se? Last year it was said that transportation of this hydrogen is not viable",
    'CMD: Who is that? Atul Mehra: Atul Mehra from Motilal Oswal Asset Management, sir.

So what is the thought process about the IPO per se? Last year it was said that transportation of this hydrogen is not viable. So, are we in-house only developing those cylinders and all and developing or we are just going to pass on the hydrogen to those companies, sir? Thank you, sir. CMD: Okay, should I start attempting to? One more at the back. Koundinya: Yes, hi, thanks for the opportunity, sir. This is Koundinya from JPMorgan. So, sir, firstly on the renewable capacity addition, so you spoke about around 6 GW of capacity addition all put together for FY24 within which 4.6 GW is only the conventional. So just trying to understand, are there some bottlenecks that you are seeing with respect to capacity addition on the RE front at this point in time? And second thing, now that the CERC regulations are in each way being discussed for a next control period, and you did speak about lower PLFs with higher RE capacity addition. So, are there some discussions going on to compensate for loss of PLF incentives over there? And lastly, if you can speak about some the kind of returns that you are envisaging in the green initiatives or even on the nuclear front, if you can speak, provide some color on that. Thank you. CMD: Okay. Let me start attempting, and then I will request my colleagues to just respond to the few questions. I think the most prominent question is that this NGEL IPO, how it is, how much percentage, when it is, how much it is, and how the capex is going to be from the renewable energy? I think just simplicity and then I will ask Director (Finance) also to just chip in on that, whatever the missing link is, if there is any',
    'Thank you. CMD: Okay. Let me start attempting, and then I will request my colleagues to just respond to the few questions.

I think just simplicity and then I will ask Director (Finance) also to just chip in on that, whatever the missing link is, if there is any. So, the first thing is that we have just started the work. We will be very careful, and we will be watching the market before hitting the market. How much it is required? I think we will start with the minimum and then let us see that how much will be required because you all know that we are generating enough cash to fund our ongoing projects or our capex. So, it is not going to happen just tomorrow or day after. Unless Page 16 of 23 NTPC Limited July 31, 2023 the government is directing me to do it, then by this date it has to be done. So, I think this is what I hope that I am clarifying in a simplified way. So, I think, there can be n number of questions around that, but I think as of now this is what it is. So, there was a direction from the government for the monetization and it still exists. We had complied last year, and we will see that we will go on doing what is required. But as of now I can only say that we will try to realize the good value, otherwise it is not the time bound rather than it should be value based rather than the time bound. So, I hope that this all questions related to the NGEL IPO are more or less covered. The first question, who was the first one to just say four years, five years is going to be a peak shortage? Let me try to give my perspective and what, as NTPC, what we keep discussing. There had been quite a good amount of inventory which is I think getting exhausted and that is the reason that we have started just even looking at the coal-based assets in addition to our renewable',
    'So, I hope that this all questions related to the NGEL IPO are more or less covered. The first question, who was the first one to just say four years, five years is going to be a peak shortage? Let me try to give my perspective and what, as NTPC, what we keep discussing. There had been quite a good amount of inventory which is I think getting exhausted and that is the reason that we have started just even looking at the coal-based assets in addition to our renewable. You can rest assured that you keep consuming as much power as you can, provided you are paying for that, obviously. And rest assured that we will be taking care of those increase in the demand and how the projections are going to come, so without any hesitation. The 7 GW is not something which is new thing. This was already under kind of the planning or this kind of the drawing board and then what we are saying is these are the ongoing projects which we are taking. As per the CEA projections, I think we will be requiring around 250 - 252 GW of coal based thermal capacity on the outer side. There are different scenarios. This is the most stress scenario on that side. But nevertheless, if there is a more requirement, let us see our economy rather than getting at 7%, tomorrow we start growing at 10% and there is a further need, I think then we will go for the further capacity addition on that side. The idea is that power should be available, it should be available on demand, and it should be reliable, and it should be affordable. And it will be cleaner as we are going forward because of this SOx, NOx and other efficiency parameters, whatever it takes. So, whatever it takes, I think that is what we will have to meet the energy requirement, we have to meet the power requirement in the country. So, we are committed towards that, and the government takes the decision in the holistic way',

So, we are committed towards that, and the government takes the decision in the holistic way. It is not only we will be doing but we will be playing the leading role in whatever it comes as far as the power sector is concerned. I hope that this is there anything else what anybody would like to add on this side. Director (Finance): Talking about renewable business, now if you look at the overall picture which we said that 130 GW is the overall capacity and 60 GW, we are targeting in renewables. Of course, this target is with a little bit of redundancy considering the fact that, as we move ahead in the next 10 years, there could be surprises in one so that we always should have a latitude of pushing it on. But as far as the ballpark figure I would say is that an amount of Rs.40,000 to Rs.60,000 crore of equity would be required. And so, the IPO thing is not out of a compulsive need for money because the group’s cash flows are capable enough to take care of this equity thing. But it is more in terms of since the renewable side presents a tremendous opportunity for growth to capture this and Page 17 of 23 unlock value out of this growth initiative, we have this plan but however when exactly to do and you know in what way it is to be done is a matter of strategy as we go ahead. Thank you. CMD: Okay, so the next question was NML, NTPC Mining Limited. We are power generating NTPC Limited July 31, 2023 company mainly. We are transforming ourselves to energy, but mining is completely different than the power generation',
    "Thank you. CMD: Okay, so the next question was NML, NTPC Mining Limited. We are power generating NTPC Limited July 31, 2023 company mainly. We are transforming ourselves to energy, but mining is completely different than the power generation. So, the DNA of the company really suits to the requirement on that side. So, now what we are doing is that mines will go to NML and there will be a full-fledged subsidiary, which will be taking care of the mining. These will remain as captive coal blocks to us, there is no doubt. But just for information of all others, who might have missed, even today with the permission from the government, you can sell some of the coal from that after meeting your own requirement. NML is not the NCL. NML is NTPC Mining Limited. So, we will be also looking at some of the opportunities if it comes, on the other mining things. It can be tomorrow limestone, it can be tomorrow let's say lithium, tomorrow it can be anything, I am just saying from the kind of very low value items to the very high-cost items on that. So, and that's the reason, there is a lot of sense and the rationale to go for this mining company. And this will be working like a mining company, and it will have its own profit and loss and it will even have a few of the subsidiaries, like what Coal India has. Probably it will come somewhere in between. So this is what the idea is. So, though we had this work in progress, it has taken a little longer. We had finally convinced the government and thanks to the government that it has been agreed upon. First, it was recommended by power ministry and then it was with the coal ministry, and it has been now done deal on that side. So, now we have to do the actual transfer. So that is from the NML side. PSP, how it helps the renewable? I think this was the question to start with. PSP is pumped storage. So, it does not have its own kind of flowing water or reservoir, it is a kind of this thing. So, what is requirement? It's not necessary",

So, it does not have its own kind of flowing water or reservoir, it is a kind of this thing. So, what is requirement? It's not necessary. It's not that, it's not there. But it can be a kind of upper reservoir and lower reservoir and the water does not go anywhere. During the daytime, you can store, and you can utilize that excess energy and to pump the water from the lower reservoir to the higher reservoir and during the peak hours, you can extract that energy out of it. So basically, it is energy storage, and this is the best energy storage options for India as of today, I am just saying. And this is the least cost energy storage solution as of now. Then what else can it be? Hydrogen, methane, ammonia, these are the really future and we are aggressively working on this. Let me assure you that, we are not going to be left behind. Our teams are working on some of the demonstration projects at present, but they are also working aggressively for, it was mentioned some time back, that we will be also working on how to develop the hydrogen hub and our site at Pudimadaka, in case of Andhra Pradesh, where we have 1,200 acres of land. If you can imagine, we are trying to see that we can develop the hydrogen hub which will be a, which will be not only taking the hydrogen, green hydrogen and trying to convert into hydrogen and it will be taking the renewable energy and then converting it into the green hydrogen and green ammonia but also the other chemicals or maybe even the manufacturing of some of the electrolyzers and other things. We are not going to do on our own. By the way, we cannot get into manufacturing",

We are not going to do on our own. By the way, we cannot get into manufacturing. This is a clear-cut decision as of today unless it is then there will be further things which is going to come on that. But hydrogen and ammonia Page 18 of 23 NTPC Limited July 31, 2023 are future, and we are working on that and there is a group, which is under NGEL which is working on that in all fronts. We have a general manager, which we appointed almost four years back to look after the green hydrogen and this is what are the developments, which are happening. We can have the further discussion whosoever is interested in this subject. And it may be also the green ammonia is one, but there is a green methanol which is also equivalent, it is equally important to take care of the green chemicals and green energy carrier on that side. I was in Goa, G20 last week. We had a very good meeting with the International Marine Organization, they are looking at both ammonia as well as green methanol. So, there are a number of opportunities, which are emerging. And on the lighter side, I think I might have told last time that NTPC someday will become national transport, power, and chemicals. So, we are not only thermal power company and there is a lot of synergies, which are coming and as the world moves, development happens. We will be having more and more opportunities to just work on those sides. Water saving, what was the question? Water saving is this is what we are going ahead with the air-cooled condenser',

We will be having more and more opportunities to just work on those sides. Water saving, what was the question? Water saving is this is what we are going ahead with the air-cooled condenser. Air cooled condenser does not require evaporation and that is how it is really saving a lot of water. And this is, what was mentioned, it really saves 75% compared to the normal conventional power. So, we have already commissioned in North Karanpura, and we will be doing that in our Patratu and going forward, wherever it is essential. Better equipment for energy saving, BLDCs, etc. this comes in the demand side, not the supply side. So, it's a power generation. But Bureau of Energy Efficiency is working a lot on that. Please visit that site and you will be coming to know that this LED, etc. this is started and there is an energy efficient fan. Now there are energy efficient air conditioner and what not on that side. There is a whole lot of kind of full-fledged scope on those side, how to conserve and how to reduce the energy consumption. The 17% capacity and 25% on the generation, we should give the credit to our engineers, starting from the designers to the operating personnel, that they are able to maintain the assets. As I just mentioned some time back, our Singrauli plant is 42 years old, and we are able to run it at 100%. Whereas there was some myth which was being talked about that coal-based power plant, the life is 25 years. So, and I just mentioned about our Korba, so then credit should go to how it is constructed, how it is maintained and how it is operated. Coal based capacity, Timeline, I just mentioned. I think this is up to 2030, which I think Director (Projects) will give",

I think this is up to 2030, which I think Director (Projects) will give. Director (Projects): Coal based capacity addition timeline, see in 2023-24 we will add 3600 MW. In 2024-25 we will be adding 3,580 MW and in 2025-26, we will be adding 1460 MW. Then TTPS Unit-1 660 MW will be commissioned in 2026-27. In 2027-28, we expect to have 2260 MW, Talcher Unit- 2, and Lara, both the units. In 2028-29, we expect 4,000 MW, which will be Sipat one unit, Darlipalli one unit, Singrauli, both the units, and Meja one unit. In 2029-30, will be completing the capacity addition with 1,600 MW capacity. Page 19 of 23 CMD: So, this is up to 2030, and what was suggested that, if economy goes further up and then there is NTPC Limited July 31, 2023 further requirement, we will have to start looking at something on that. Okay, the next question was the long-term or this something on the THDC and NEEPCO. I have the exact number with me that whatever we have got the letter for allotment, it is 6,291 MW, for THDC 2,950 and for NEEPCO 3,341. And there are further, this is in the kind of pipeline, so when I was saying around 8,000, so 6,291 is kind of, already the letter is there and maybe some kind of MOU is being signed this month itself. You would have seen that, there is something to SJVNL and NHPC also. So, it is similar to THDC and NEEPCO. THDC and NEEPCO are our subsidiaries. So, our hydro is coming mainly through these two arms, and we will make sure that, we are meeting the requirement of the capex for those companies also',
    'And there are further, this is in the kind of pipeline, so when I was saying around 8,000, so 6,291 is kind of, already the letter is there and maybe some kind of MOU is being signed this month itself. You would have seen that, there is something to SJVNL and NHPC also. So, it is similar to THDC and NEEPCO. THDC and NEEPCO are our subsidiaries. So, our hydro is coming mainly through these two arms, and we will make sure that, we are meeting the requirement of the capex for those companies also. And they are generating on their own also, but I think we will try to see that, we as the shareholder and we as the holding company will be able to take care of that. Director (Projects): We can give them a sense of the capex that we are planning. The group capex for the current year is Rs.27,104 crore. Next year, it will be Rs.38,692 crore, and then next year, that is 2025- 26, it will be Rs.49,000 crore and in 2026-27, it will be around Rs.58,000 crore. In 2027-28, it will be Rs.50,600 crore. In 2028-29, it will be Rs.40,000 crore and in 2029-30, it will be around Rs.38,000 crore. We have projected up to that. This includes our nuclear also. CMD: Okay. So, moving further. How much is the C&I in 20 GW? Okay. Go ahead. CEO (NGEL): C&I would actually add up to about 10 GW out of this 20 GW, in terms of the actual installed capacity. CMD: Okay, base load plus peak load gas, I think gas, whether it is going to be? Yes, I think gas will have some say, but I am afraid that it will be few hours in a day and few months in the year. So, I will request Director (Operations) to just take that question on that. Director (Operations): Gas stations are still being run primarily for grid control. They are being run by Grid India. No discounts are actually scheduled in that power. But from the grid security point of view, it is very much essential that we have the gas plants available. So, for that, government has taken a lot of initiatives',
    "So, I will request Director (Operations) to just take that question on that. Director (Operations): Gas stations are still being run primarily for grid control. They are being run by Grid India. No discounts are actually scheduled in that power. But from the grid security point of view, it is very much essential that we have the gas plants available. So, for that, government has taken a lot of initiatives. They have instructed us to ensure fuel supply and in fact, this was for a crunch period, it was done in this financial year in the month of June, and going forward, the government sees that gas is required in order to maintain the grid discipline. So compared to last year, we already consumed lot of gas and we are going in agreement with the GAIL, to ensure further availability of gas in the long run. We are going to sign an agreement for another 4 and a half years. So, gas is going to stay here for some time to maintain the grid stability. SS&FA, MOP: Just to add on to it, gas will remain the last resort. CMD: That is the reason I just mentioned as Special Secretary said, it is just saying that this is going to be the last resort because it is very costly and we should not be unnecessarily trying to utilize it only for the grid security purpose, it is being used. Let us hope that the gas prices come down. Now it is still in double digit, if it comes in the single digit that will be really good. Okay. Page 20 of 23 NTPC Limited July 31, 2023 SMR capital outlay, I think the first thing, first stage is the SMR development itself which will be required only very less kind of capital cost but going forward, it will be huge. It can vary anything between anybody's guess as of today. So, let's not, I will not even dare to do that. It can be as high as Rs.30 crore to Rs.40 crore per MW, it may even touch Rs.50 crore also on the smaller side but there is a lot of advantages of that. So, the first thing is about the development side",
    "It can vary anything between anybody's guess as of today. So, let's not, I will not even dare to do that. It can be as high as Rs.30 crore to Rs.40 crore per MW, it may even touch Rs.50 crore also on the smaller side but there is a lot of advantages of that. So, the first thing is about the development side. So, which will be kind of some about Rs.1,000 crore in the first phase and then when you start manufacturing then it is going to be. So, it is going to be a developmental activity as of now. But this is for future. Keep in mind like the solar was 10 years back, the SMRs we have to keep track on them. Capital cost and the cost of capital competitiveness with private IPPs. Who are the gentlemen? I think that we have already responded on that side. Yes, you are right. Thank you. The first thing is, we were never scared of the competition from the IPPs. You would have seen that. That has been the track record on that side and whether it is cost of capital, we have some edge over the IPPs or our project management or our operational practices, this is what we have demonstrated, that is our core strength, which is coming and the only, I don't have the numbers but till now, our old plants are doing quite well, whatever we have in the renewable also and technically, operationally and financially. So, this is it. You want to say anything on it? Director (Projects): Yes sir, I would like to give them a reference, so that they can have more confidence on NTPC. See there is a constant argument on this IPP is cheaper, NTPC is costly. That's the argument you have. See the cost of the capex depends on two fundamental things. One is how do you engineer it and what are the quality standards. Engineering includes what is the likely availability you would like to project and all these things, loading factor, and quality definitely, how long it is going to run with that 100% capability. We have demonstrated what we have done",

Engineering includes what is the likely availability you would like to project and all these things, loading factor, and quality definitely, how long it is going to run with that 100% capability. We have demonstrated what we have done. Now, if you compare, I'm not telling all IPPs, some of the IPPs are also good. If you compare now the solar, you will understand the solar, the substantial portion of the generation comes in from a module. So, what I purchase, the IPP also purchases. But we are mostly competitive in solar. So, why there should be an argument that apple-to-apple basis if we compare the coal fire power station, we are costly. We are not. The comparison comes because our things are better engineered with higher quality. CMD: Okay, so the next question was on the NEP and there is something on that, how much it is on the lower side. I just responded that yes, if whatever is required, we will see those on that side. So, it is not something which is done on one year and then we have to stick to them forever. So, it can be on the higher side, I can agree on that. In the RE, what is the bottleneck? I don't know. Then it's Mohit, you wanted to respond to that on that, there was one question. What is this loss of PLF? I think then this. Yes. No, no, but why you call it the loss of PLF? Analyst: I was saying loss of PLF incentive, potential loss of PLF incentive. CMD: No, no, I think, okay, the incentives mainly were then only above 85% of the PLF. So, I think Pithead Power Station, yes, Pithead Power Station still runs and it's almost more than 85%, but Page 21 of 23 NTPC Limited July 31, 2023 at the same time if there is a backing down, we are compensated for that efficiency loss. So, this is included in the regulatory mechanism",

So, this is included in the regulatory mechanism. Green initiatives and nuclear. I think this is what we have been covering on that part. Is there anything specific you wanted to ask? Analyst: No, I was asking you know that kind of returns that you are targeting both on the renewable front and also on the new initiatives, what is the kind of capex and also the returns that you are targeting here? CMD: Yes, that we had responded on that part. But okay, I am still not very clear on that. See, IRR, it cannot be just like there is -- it has to be on a benchmark, and it has to be a double digit anyway. So, we cannot go in the kind of, this is not a regulated sector as far as the renewable is concerned. But you cannot say that this is the exactly one IRR I have to take it. So, you have to be something on the higher side, something you can take little on the lower side, but more or less it will be at par with our regulated sector. Director (Finance): If I may add, see in a conventional safe business which you know on a cost-plus basis you have a return of 15.50% which is available by the regulator. Do you know the gestation period is almost 5 to 6 years, so that translates to something around 12.5% IRR. So, that would be our endeavor, in the sense that, there is a trade-off, like in order to, there is compulsion you need to add capacities and also go on the renewable side that is the agenda",
    'Director (Finance): If I may add, see in a conventional safe business which you know on a cost-plus basis you have a return of 15.50% which is available by the regulator.

So, that would be our endeavor, in the sense that, there is a trade-off, like in order to, there is compulsion you need to add capacities and also go on the renewable side that is the agenda. But in that process let us say if I am very aggressive, I am also pursuing some capacities on merchant, I am also pursuing some capacity on C&I. The endeavor would be to fit in closely with the IRR which we are doing. However, I mean more than an IRR I would say the kind of profitability because IRR can be financial wizardry also, you all understand. So, leave aside the IRR, we will have returns which would be adequate enough to maintain. Analyst: Sure, sir. That answers my question. Thank you. CMD: So, if I have taken then a few of the messages, I think mainly it was on the NGEL IPO, the capacity addition, the renewables, the hydrogen, and I think then another one is coming out to within what kind of capacity. I think just be reassured that the demand is increasing, the inventory is getting exhausted, so we will have to go on adding the capacity both on renewable side as well as on the conventional side. We have a lot of space in our power stations, existing power stations, so we are not required to go to the Greenfield. That is what our endeavor will be unless there is something. Incidentally, I have not mentioned that the Government of UP has already approved one joint venture. We will be going ahead with the 50-50% and one of the existing sites, Obra as of now, and followed by Anpara, that is another one which is going to be. There are other state governments who are talking to us. So, I think this is all round',

There are other state governments who are talking to us. So, I think this is all round. It is not only one, it’s not only renewable, it’s not only green hydrogen, green ammonia, it’s as he mentioned the gas is also coming into that, but the last resort it was just rightly corrected. So, there is enough I think growth and we will be taking the leadership in this also and we will try to not only maintain our share, but I think we will try to increase that from 25%. I think that should be giving a kind of and we are not really out of cash, we are generating enough cash which can really support this kind of our capex requirement and the growth on that side. Page 22 of 23 So, I think with the team's capability, we will be able to really go on doing what we had been demonstrating in the past. So, before I conclude, I would request Special Secretary sir to see if there are a few things what he wanted to convey. NTPC Limited July 31, 2023 SS & FA, MOP: Well, there was a lot of discussion about asset monetization, when the IPO will come, how the IPO will come. As you know, we require huge capital investment in coming years, looking into the demand of energy sector and it is not only in this sector, but in almost in all sectors of government wherever PSUs are working, infrastructure works, and capital demand is growing. And when there is a huge demand, our PSUs go to the market. They leave very little space for private sector to come out or I will say the space for private sector gets limited",
    'As you know, we require huge capital investment in coming years, looking into the demand of energy sector and it is not only in this sector, but in almost in all sectors of government wherever PSUs are working, infrastructure works, and capital demand is growing. And when there is a huge demand, our PSUs go to the market. They leave very little space for private sector to come out or I will say the space for private sector gets limited. In order to remove this imbalance, government has taken this policy decision that some of the part of this capital requirement should be generated by the CPSEs themselves by asset monetization and this is how this whole picture fits that they should generate some of the capital required for their future growth from within their own assets. ED (Finance): Thank you Sir. We now conclude this 19th Annual Analysts and Investors Meet. I am grateful to our CMD, Special Secretary and Financial Advisor, Ministry of Power, our Directors and Senior Management present here for taking out time for this interaction. The address by CMD and the presentation by Director (Finance) highlighted the achievements of NTPC and showcased the potential that we have. I am thankful to all our analysts and investors who are present here today, whose faith has driven us to exceed our performance, both operationally and financially, year after year. Last but not the least, my heartfelt thanks to Regional Executive Director, Western Region and his team, for making arrangements for a successful meet. We hope to see you next year. I now invite all of you for refreshments. Thank you. ******************************* Page 23 of 23'

    'Like always, we will start with consolidated financial, and I will hand it over to Kiran and Anshuman for Digital Services part of it and then Gaurav for Reliance Retail and Sanjay for E&P upstream business and I will take it back you to complete O2C and final comments. So, starting with results for this quarter, consolidated EBITDA is close to Rs. 35,000 crore up 14% Year-on- Year led by consumer businesses and upstream. Net profit was at ₹15,512 crore, up marginally on year-on- year basis. Earnings were impacted by lower O2C contribution on year-on-year basis and the impact was sharper in quarter-on-quarter basis. The O2C performance was impacted by volatility in product margins, the fact that economy was subdued and subdued downstream demand, and introduction of Special Additional Excise Duty (SAED). The consumer part of the businesses has performed exceptionally well, with robust Retail revenues and EBITDA also remained strong with growth across consumption baskets. We saw increased rebound in footfalls and benefited from the strengthening of digital channel. On the Digital Services side, the customers have increased to around 428 million and strong growth in ARPU was witnessed on year-on-year basis. The Oil & Gas business benefited from sustained production through operational excellence and better realization with increase in ceiling price for the domestic gas. So, overall, diversified earnings streams did cushion the impact of volatile energy markets. When you look at each of the segment performance, Retail posted around Rs. 65,000 crore of revenue and EBITDA of Rs. 4,414 crore. On the year-on-year basis the growth rate for revenue was 43% and for EBITDA 51%. The total store count was well above 16,000 mark – 16,600 to be precise. We have added 795 new stores in second quarter of FY23, this is over and above 792 stores we have added in the previous quarter. The number of transactions across Retail channels were up 45% on year-on-year basis',

We have added 795 new stores in second quarter of FY23, this is over and above 792 stores we have added in the previous quarter. The number of transactions across Retail channels were up 45% on year-on-year basis. Record 180 million footfalls across all formats were 23% above pre-COVID period. What is really heartening is the launch of JioMart on WhatsApp and the important point is it has garnered 37% of orders from the customers who are new to the JioMart. Moving to Digital Services side, the business has reported close to Rs. 30,000 crore of revenue and EBITDA close to Rs. 12,300 crore. The growth rates for revenue were 21% and EBITDA up 29%. ARPU was at Rs. 177.2 with improving subscriber mix. Strong growth, healthy customer traction with net addition of 7.7 million subscribers in this quarter. The engagement statistics has reflected in many parameters including the fact that of data consumption has crossed 22 GB per user. © Reliance Industries Limited 2020 2 On O2C side, revenue was up 33% and EBITDA was down 6% on year-on-year basis. So, strong middle distillate cracks with tight supply in Europe with demand coming from gas to oil switching. However, we did see weak polymer margins amid volatile feedstock prices lower demand. Polyester was kind of stable, but the earnings were impacted because of high crude costs, OSPs were significantly higher, freight costs were higher, insurance costs were higher. Importantly, we did have the introduction of SAED on transportation fuel that worked out to Rs 4039 crore as far as EBITDA is concerned, and we have lower volumes due to planned turnarounds that we had',

Importantly, we did have the introduction of SAED on transportation fuel that worked out to Rs 4039 crore as far as EBITDA is concerned, and we have lower volumes due to planned turnarounds that we had. On quarter-on-quarter EBITDA was impacted by 40% because of sequential decline in margins as well as SAED. Oil and gas strong story, EBITDA was up 3X compared to what it was a year ago. We had realisations of $9.9 MMBTU against the 2.75 what we saw in the same quarter last year. Production remained stable at 19 MMSCMD, contributing 20% to India’s gas production. We are on track to commission MJ field by year-end. Sanjay will talk more about it in his section. In consolidated numbers, year-on-year revenues were up 32%, oil prices being higher, EBITDA saw strong growth led by retail, Digital Services and Oil & Gas segment, but there was subdued O2C contribution. Net profit was flat on year-on-year basis, we did see increase in finance costs on the back of tightening of monetary policy actions globally. Also, we did see increased depreciation on the back of expanded asset base, higher network utilisation as well as upstream production. Overall, that really explains why net profit was flat and just want to emphasise that SAED was also increased, contributing to flat net profit, impacting even on quarter-on-quarter basis. So, with this range, Rs 30,000 crore EBITDA in Q2FY22 moved up to close to Rs 35,000 crore due to strong performance of Oil & Gas, Retail and Digital Services. O2C EBITDA was lower by Rs. 752 crore, essentially due to crude, weaker polymers and aromatics margins and introduction of SAED. The Oil & Gas, Retail and Digital Services we already talked about',
    'So, with this range, Rs 30,000 crore EBITDA in Q2FY22 moved up to close to Rs 35,000 crore due to strong performance of Oil & Gas, Retail and Digital Services. O2C EBITDA was lower by Rs. 752 crore, essentially due to crude, weaker polymers and aromatics margins and introduction of SAED. The Oil & Gas, Retail and Digital Services we already talked about. All-in-all very impressive growth and on Q-on-Q basis the big impact was on O2C side and overall, some amount of contribution coming from other businesses, but we did see a strong fall in O2C side. This is the slide on gross debt and net debt. Gross debt as on September 2022 was Rs 294,859 crore and net debt was at Rs. 93,253 crore. Just to highlight that in the first half of FY23 capex was completely funded by cash profits, it is well funded. This capex is really in line with what we have been talking about in terms of growth across all our sectors including O2C, New Energy, Jio as well as Retail. This is a part of our planed strategy to capture growth opportunity. The capex is funded by our cash profits. The increase in debt was, what you are seeing, is attributed to higher working capital due to significant dislocation in energy markets. There is an impact of translation of foreign currency liabilities with rupee depreciation the debt needs to be restated in today’s rupee terms. And also, while we bought this spectrum that is spread over 20 years, the first instalment has to be paid, so that is also contributing to overall increase in debt. This where I will hand it over to Kiran and Anshuman to take you through Digital Services. © Reliance Industries Limited 2020 3 Sh Kiran Thomas 00:08:14 – 00:17:57 (Digital Services) Another great quarter with very strong performance. If you look at all these metrics, which we report regularly, we are still number one in AGR market share at 45%. In terms of the subscriber market, 36% of the total market, or 428 million customers',
    "This where I will hand it over to Kiran and Anshuman to take you through Digital Services. © Reliance Industries Limited 2020 3 Sh Kiran Thomas 00:08:14 – 00:17:57 (Digital Services) Another great quarter with very strong performance. If you look at all these metrics, which we report regularly, we are still number one in AGR market share at 45%. In terms of the subscriber market, 36% of the total market, or 428 million customers. More than 28 billion gigabytes of data was delivered in this quarter, with a daily run rate of more than 13 billion minutes of voice. And as was alluded to earlier in the presentation, now exceeding 22 gigabytes of data consumption per user per month. And of course, on the big screen proposition that we offer, which is our Jio set-top box, I think the engagement continues to grow and now it has exceeded about six hours per day. Customer engagement continues to grow and if you look at the chart, today, it is obviously 22 GB. But if you just compare it to like-to-like basis from two years back, these numbers have nearly doubled over this period. ARPU has also grown, as a consequence, and today our ARPU of ₹177 on like-to-like basis, is an industry leading performance. Of course, the 5G rollout that is now underway, will substantially improve both consumption as well as the subscriber mix, and this is expected to improve both the per capita usage as well as ARPU going ahead. I'm talking a bit about the 5G proposition that we are bringing to market. We believe it is quite differentiated from everybody else in the market. We call it the True 5G advantage, and there are effectively four components of what we count as a True 5G advantage. Number one is what we call the Standalone Architecture. Which is the most cutting-edge architecture of 5G that is being deployed anywhere in the world. Number two is the unique spectrum holdings that we have, to launch 5G services",
    "I'm talking a bit about the 5G proposition that we are bringing to market. We believe it is quite differentiated from everybody else in the market.

Which is the most cutting-edge architecture of 5G that is being deployed anywhere in the world. Number two is the unique spectrum holdings that we have, to launch 5G services. Number three is a unique technical capability that we call Carrier Aggregation, which allows us to combine all the spectrum holdings across the multiple bands that we have into a single unified data highway. And number four is the rich tech partner ecosystem that we have built, which is enabling us to deliver solutions which are quite unparalleled in the country. Now picking one each of these elements in turn. What is Standalone Architecture (SA). Just to mention it, conceptually, it is a completely standalone version of 5G which unlocks the full potential of 5G asset technology. To contrast it with what everybody else in the market, other competitors in the market are looking to launch, which is called non-standalone (NSA), which still leverages the 4G network, in terms of the core signalling capabilities. So, what does SA have over and above the NSA capability? Obviously, being a completely standalone 5G network, we are able to deliver absolute lowest latency end-to-end latency that 5G enables, which means that things like cloud gaming, augmented reality and a number of real-time enterprise use cases can only be supported on SA. Of course, being the completely undiluted version of 5G, we get better speeds. And looking to enterprises, advanced capabilities like network slicing, which is creating a virtual network dedicated to a certain enterprise or a segment is only possible with standalone architecture",
    "Of course, being the completely undiluted version of 5G, we get better speeds. And looking to enterprises, advanced capabilities like network slicing, which is creating a virtual network dedicated to a certain enterprise or a segment is only possible with standalone architecture. And as we start rolling out the Internet of Things, being connected in large numbers, the 5G capability to deliver as your machine- to-machine type communication is also only possible with SA. And of course, SA delivers superior power efficiency and therefore it's greener and more sustainable. Number two, we spoke about the unique 5G spectrum footprint. If you look at the 5G spectrum holdings across all the operators, we are, today if you look at our holding cities, nearly equal to the combined holdings of the other two major players in the market. And more than the quantity itself, in terms of the quality, we have the sub gigahertz spectrum in the 700-megahertz band. We have the mid band, which is the sweet spot for 5G services in the 3.5 gigahertz band, and obviously millimeter wave, which is where we have phenomenal capacity for variety of use cases in the 26 gigahertz band. So, this combination of holdings means that through the sub- © Reliance Industries Limited 2020 4 gigahertz and obviously the mid band, we get deep indoor coverage. And obviously as you get into the millimeter wave you have near fiber like speeds that we can deliver over wireless spectrum. Talking about Carrier Aggregation. This is a technology which allows us to combine all these three spectrum bands and treat it as you can see in the graphic to the right. You can treat it almost like a single unified data highway",
    "And obviously as you get into the millimeter wave you have near fiber like speeds that we can deliver over wireless spectrum. Talking about Carrier Aggregation. This is a technology which allows us to combine all these three spectrum bands and treat it as you can see in the graphic to the right. You can treat it almost like a single unified data highway. And what that means is when it comes to uplink, which is where most of the constraints are from the low-power devices coming back to our network, we can leverage the 700 MHz there because that gives you deep indoor coverage and, on the downlink, for example, we can now combine the mid band as well as the millimeter wave combination. So, really mixing and matching spectrum holdings with what they're good at and treating them as a single, logical and virtual unified data highway is what Carrier Aggregation is all about. Talking about the deep partnerships, pretty much the who’s who in this industry, everybody that matters, has partnered with Jio. If you take Qualcomm, they have deep intellectual property assets. And we are working very closely with them to create the next generation 5G infrastructure, especially focused on the millimeter wave and the sub gigahertz frequency bands. And since they have intellectual property that is used by a number of players in the 5G ecosystem, they're also a strong partner with us to really go and develop and shape that ecosystem, and to make sure that we have the richest possible ecosystem in India. Meta, who is now working on the next wave of immersive technologies, are an investor and a strong partner working very closely with us to really use 5G to bring those next set of immersive experiences to India. Google, again we are working very closely with them, especially on Google Cloud, to offer everything from private 5G stack that is basically taking the technology that we have developed and posting it as a private stack for enterprises. They can do that on GCP today",

Google, again we are working very closely with them, especially on Google Cloud, to offer everything from private 5G stack that is basically taking the technology that we have developed and posting it as a private stack for enterprises. They can do that on GCP today. And of course, a number of other 5G-enabled solutions, which ride on top of our network. Again, a deep partnership with GCP to be able to bring some of the cloud native solutions. Intel, another investor, and a strong tech player globally. Using their technology and expertise to build the next generation cloud and edge data centers, which will obviously be required to unlock the next wave of applications that take advantage of 5G. From the network perspective, pretty much everybody, every leading vendor, is today working with us, Nokia, Ericsson, Samsung, Cisco, just to name the most prominent of them. Looking at the True 5G strategy, there is a strong story that we can tell for pretty much every segment. If you look at homes, really accelerating the rollout of near fiber-like broadband to homes. Really looking at not just bringing broadband but also streaming television consumption. If you look forward, which is really what's happening globally, interactive television experiences really is the first wave of things that Indian homes can expect, thanks to True 5G bringing home broadband connectivity. On the mobility side, obviously accelerating that consumption that we saw – the near doubling of consumption on the mobile network over the last two years – we see that trend growing and 5G is a core foundation to support that growth, and of course bringing the next wave of high-quality customers onto Jio. Small and medium businesses. These are under-served segments, pretty much like homes",

Again, not just delivering broadband but also working with a number of ecosystem partners to deliver cloud-native and edge- enabled solutions for businesses. And of course, Enterprises, again, using the power of True 5G to support a number of use cases, things like smart factories and so on, which is again using a combination of True 5G and Edge computing. So, if you look at it, really transformative set of solutions and capabilities that we're delivering to pretty much every segment in India. And with that, I'll hand it over to Anshuman, who will talk about operations and financial aspects. © Reliance Industries Limited 2020 5 Sh Anshuman Thakur 00:17:58 – 00:21:03 (Digital Services - Financials) Thank you, Kiran. I'll cover the operational and financial results for the quarter now. We have a good strong financial performance for the quarter. In Jio Platforms Ltd, consolidated revenues came in at ₹24,275 crore. That was a growth of 22.7% year on year. And the consolidated EBITDA came in at ₹12,011 crore, which was a higher growth 29.2% year on year. Really reflecting the operating leverage more than anything else. SUC impact has started. There was an element of SUC impact in the last quarter, but the data traffic growth was very healthy. During the quarter, the total data carried on the network was 28.2 exabytes. That's another 22.6% growth year on year. Per capita data consumption was 22 GB per user. The subscriber base at the end of the quarter was 427.6 million. ARPU increased to ₹177.2 through increased usage and subscriber quality of subscriber base",

The subscriber base at the end of the quarter was 427.6 million. ARPU increased to ₹177.2 through increased usage and subscriber quality of subscriber base. And as Kiran mentioned, we are gearing up for our 5G rollout. Pan-India rollout by the end of next year. A lot of progress has already been made on that front. The operating matrices all look quite good. Customer base 427.6 million where we have leadership both in the customer subscriber market share and revenue market share. We are continuing to grow every quarter. ARPU came in at ₹177.2 Rupees. The data traffic increased 23% year on year and the per capita data usage 22.2 GB. The voice consumption reduced slightly from the previous quarter, which could be due to a combination of reasons, including people becoming more mobile in the post-COVID world. So that ease of consumption may have gone down and also the impact of OTT communication apps. The key financials for RJIL, the connectivity business, which continues to show very strong healthy and consistent growth. This quarter, the operating revenues were at ₹22,521 crore and EBITDA at ₹11,601 crore. The EBITDA margin increased 51.5% for this quarter and EBITDA growth of 29% year on year is fairly healthy. And the consolidated JPL financials now, where the quarter operating revenues for the quarter was at ₹24,075 crore, EBITDA at ₹12,000 crore and net profit at ₹4,729 crore. So, all of these growing were anywhere between 20-30% on a year-on-year basis. With that, we come to the end of the operating and financial summary for this quarter for Jio. I'm going to hand over to Gaurav for the update on the retail business",

I'm going to hand over to Gaurav for the update on the retail business. Sh Gaurav Jain 00:21:06 – 00:40:26 (Reliance Retail) Let me start the presentation by spending a minute on the operating context. The impact of pandemic has been waning quarter after quarter progressively. And it can also be seen from the boost in footfall that we see is pre- COVID period, a 23% growth over the same period is a strong number for us. In absolute terms, it was a period for highest footfalls at 118 million customers who visited our stores across geographies. This was also the period where we saw growth across all town classes. We also saw continued growth in demand in the digital commerce channels. And when looking at the consumer side, the sentiments remained upbeat. The spend on discretionary category continues to grow. That is also visible to us through the growth in all our discretionary categories as well. © Reliance Industries Limited 2020 6 Talking about the key highlights for the quarter, the business delivered all-time high revenues led by a broad- based growth across the consumption baskets. It was a very well-rounded growth for our businesses. We also delivered our highest EBITDA for this period, operating leverage efficiencies, and also favourable mix really drove margin improvement. We continue to operate at scale. Transactions grew over a healthy 45% year on year to cross 250 million transactions, that results to over 2.5 million transactions on a daily basis, which is a very large-scale operations across geographies and formats",
    'It was a very well-rounded growth for our businesses. We also delivered our highest EBITDA for this period, operating leverage efficiencies, and also favourable mix really drove margin improvement. We continue to operate at scale. Transactions grew over a healthy 45% year on year to cross 250 million transactions, that results to over 2.5 million transactions on a daily basis, which is a very large-scale operations across geographies and formats. We opened 795 new stores during the period, but more notably, we added 9.2 million square foot of space, which is a 20% growth for last quarter, and possibly one of the largest expansions of retail space by any retailer around the world in a short period. Digital and New Commerce businesses continued to drive strong performance. Daily orders were up 53% year-on-year, and our merchant base continues to scale up and doubled over last year. We continue to also strengthen our capabilities through partnerships and acquisitions. In August, we unveiled the JioMart-WhatsApp integration initiative. We also made investments into Insight Cosmetics to further bolster our game into the beauty business. We also saw strong growth coming from consumer electronics and lifestyle businesses, which grew by over 40%. Digital and New Commerce channels grew over 60% year-on-year, and they also had a very steady contribution at 18% of the overall revenues for us. While the revenue growth continues strong, our profit delivery was at its best. EBITDA was at a new high of 4,404 crores. EBITDA margin saw a 30-basis point improvement at 7.6%. EBITDA margins from operations was 130 basis points margin expansion year on year at 7.4%. And that was led by a very favourable mix of revenues across the consumption baskets and also operating leverage in efficiencies. In particular, EBITA in grocery, fashion & lifestyle, and consumers all of these consumption baskets we saw doubling year on year',
    "EBITDA was at a new high of 4,404 crores. EBITDA margin saw a 30-basis point improvement at 7.6%. EBITDA margins from operations was 130 basis points margin expansion year on year at 7.4%. And that was led by a very favourable mix of revenues across the consumption baskets and also operating leverage in efficiencies. In particular, EBITA in grocery, fashion & lifestyle, and consumers all of these consumption baskets we saw doubling year on year. Our efforts in expansion are on track, we opened 795 stores during this period to end the total store count at 16,617 stores at the end of September. Notably, I said 9 million square feet of space added when we compare it to previous periods, that's more than twice that we saw in the previous quarter, and over three times that we saw last year. So, while we continue to add more space through geographies for better touchpoints with our consumers, we also continue to strengthen our capabilities on the back-end supply chain side. During this period, we added nearly 5.5 million square feet of warehouse space, taking our total supply chain area to about 31.4 million square feet. This is also quarter where we crossed over total employees to four lakh employees. We added 35,000 people on to the rolls, taking our total employee base to 4.14 lakh. Looking at the financial summary for the business, gross revenue 43% up at 64,920 crores. EBITDA from operations to 76% to 4286 crores. EBITDA margin saw 130 basis point growth at 7.4%, total EBITDA 51% up at 4404 crores and profit after tax to 2,305 crores, which is a 36% growth. Also, a very strong growth on a sequential basis across all the parameters. Just looking at all our businesses more closely on consumer electronics. It had a very strong quarter.

Our stores delivered strong performance led by high footfall conversion remains very steady with high average values. This will also period where our resQ, which is our after sales and installation business that business also registered its festival quarterly sales. 15th August period is also becoming increasingly a big shopping period, where customers look for major shopping. And for consumer electronics, we saw that period to be our best our Independence Day Sale period with 60% growth Y-o-Y. And some of the factors like instant discounts, affordability schemes, cross promotions, all of that and it took more colour for consumers to buy and purchase Reliance Retail formats, because we operate across over cities and delivered to thousands of locations across the country, so increasingly more and more national and international brands, they see Reliance to be a partner © Reliance Industries Limited 2020 7 for launching and we have seen a large, wide number of launches of new products. iPhone 14, One Plus 10, Samsung flip phones, HP Victus Laptops, etc these are some of the launches we have seen in this period, but I think from broader perspective, there are a tremendous number of launches which are helping customers to just widen their choice base and they continue to come and shop at our stores. The period also saw a broad base growth across categories, like phones, TVs and washers, they grew 30% year on year. Our own brands business has doubled on year-on-year basis',

The period also saw a broad base growth across categories, like phones, TVs and washers, they grew 30% year on year. Our own brands business has doubled on year-on-year basis. We saw the merchant base through which we sell our products as well as licensed brands like Kelvinator that merchant base grew 10% on a sequential basis. JioMart Digital, which is the e-commerce part of the business, also grew 25% on a quarter on quarter, as well as merchant base continued to get ramped up, we added over 25% merchants on sequential basis. Looking into the fashion lifestyle part of the business, apparel and footwear which is largely driven by Trends, Trends extension formats, Trends Footwear. So, offline business really posted their best ever quarter. I think the entire festive shopping, change of season, I think all of these factors really combined help deliver a very strong double digit like for like growth for our stores. We also launched multiple new formats in the mid-premium to mass categories. So Azorte, which is a tech enabled format, Centro which is a fashion lifestyle department store format and Fashion Factory which is a brand for less format. These three new formats were launched, so focus on innovation and serving customers to what they are looking for; I think those categories really helped us to launch new formats. Our growth across categories like men formals, women western wear was the strong as customers continued to refresh their wardrobe as normalisation has set in. We also saw a big pickup in categories like Sarees and in Indian ethnic wear on the back of festive shopping. On the Ajio side, Ajio continues to grow strength to strength',
    "Our growth across categories like men formals, women western wear was the strong as customers continued to refresh their wardrobe as normalisation has set in. We also saw a big pickup in categories like Sarees and in Indian ethnic wear on the back of festive shopping. On the Ajio side, Ajio continues to grow strength to strength. Every quarter has been for the growth, so this quarter also it had its best ever quarter performance. All the matrices had a very healthy growth. The catalogue continues to be a very strong reason for customers to keep coming back and see that to be a destination for their choice of fashion. We now operate over a million options on the site. On the new commerce side, where we work with external merchants as partners, we added over 42% merchants on a year-on-year basis and also extended our coverage into new geographies, ensured that we also bring fresh fashion and better brands, especially regional brands of their choice. We added over 60,000 new SKUs and 427 brands to the ramp. On the partner brand, which is a more premium and luxury brand, that business saw 80% growth year on year because of better footfalls, expansion into newer formats which got launched, new geographies and so on. Ajio Luxe which is really a destination for luxury and premium brands; that business grew three and a half times year on year. We have over 42,000 options live on that destination format. We also launched Rowan, which is a new format from Reliance as a toy store, which is a small format, typically around 500 - 1000 sq ft in size, selling more affordable toys. So that format also got launched during this quarter and we'll also see it further ramp up as we go along. We also launched Starter through its apparel line and also extended GAS brand into kidswear as some of the big initiatives in the partner part of the business. On jewellery business, the festive sales started to really bring back growth in this quarter",
    "So that format also got launched during this quarter and we'll also see it further ramp up as we go along. We also launched Starter through its apparel line and also extended GAS brand into kidswear as some of the big initiatives in the partner part of the business. On jewellery business, the festive sales started to really bring back growth in this quarter. The network expansion also grew and combined; the business grew 16% on a year-on-year basis. The business has been leaning on to its capabilities for product designs, and through all the in-house design lab that has created for jewellery. It has launched several collections during this quarter alone and getting tremendous level of response from our customers. Lingerie, we had a very broad-based growth across all the brands that we operate now – Zivame, Amante and Clovia. The grand lingerie festival, which is a very large event from Zivame, continues to do well. It also drove double digit volume growth for the brand and had a very positive reaction from the customers as well from the © Reliance Industries Limited 2020 8 choice perspective. This is also a category where there's a lot of product innovation happening. We continue to expand into new product lines in shapewear, we also launched product lines using sustainable products from the bamboo-based fabrics. So, a lot happening on the lingerie part of the business as well. Moving on to grocery, grocery delivered its best ever quarter. Overall, for grocery, we doubled our business on a year-on-year basis. High double digits, like for like growth, led by high footfalls and average bill values. Two key events, Full Paisa Vasool as well as Tyohaar Ready Sale, these are two flagship events and both the events saw 65% and 96% respective growth on a year-on-year basis. So, a lot of traction from the consumers to come and shop on our format",

So, a lot of traction from the consumers to come and shop on our format. Our focus on making our stores more engaging for the customers has been done through premiumization and also localization, a lot of assortment from a customer's perspective. So, launch of a range of local rice as staple options, launch of low-calorie potatoes, branded coconuts…these are some of the examples of how we have been really driving premiumization into the stores. From category, because this is also an early buying season from festivities point of view, was driven by sweets and confectionaries as well as staples, f&b and dairy. We continue to strengthen our own brand play as well; we launched several products and brands in this period. We continue to strengthen our own brand play as well. We launched several products and brands during this period. Some of the notable ones include packaged water into the brand called Sure and some of the other brands like Masti and Meister Deo. I think these are the brands that also launched a large number of new products. On the new commerce side. The merchant base continues to scale up the 4X Y-o-Y. On the merchant side, revenue all-time high for the business in this segment as well. Continue to strengthen fulfilment and supply chain capabilities to ensure that all the fill rates for our supply chain are delivered on time. We commissioned 57 new facilities and we continue to add more and more infrastructure to ensure that our customers are able to serve better",

Continue to strengthen fulfilment and supply chain capabilities to ensure that all the fill rates for our supply chain are delivered on time. We commissioned 57 new facilities and we continue to add more and more infrastructure to ensure that our customers are able to serve better. And that is also visible from the cohort where we see that customers who are now well over a year into the platform their buying is now well over four times than customers who have just joined the platform. Taking through the JioMart, JioMart is a horizontal play across all white categories, and we continue to add and bolster its capabilities through expansion of catalogue and also seller base, which grew multi-fold. We talked about launch of WhatsApp to JioMart initiative, although it's still early, and that initiative is gaining momentum week after week. What is happening to see is that it has really democratized the Access to Online shopping, and we have seen 37% of the customers who have come from WhatsApp are customers were actually shopped first time on JioMart. So, it has really taken us to a new set of customers. And we continue to see that growth as we go along. Some of the other initiatives like Tyohaar Ready Sale, which also grew in our storage that registered 2.5 times growth in traffic, as well as 3x installations in app. With my Pharma, Pharma business also grew two and a half times Y-o-Y and that had been very stable across all the channels. So, we saw digital commerce orders of 95%. And also, nearly 85% of the stores are now hyperlocal enabled. So, the delivery to the customers can be service to the nearest store which ensures better delivery time and happier customers because they get access to the products on time. © Reliance Industries Limited 2020 9 Our new commerce business has a very steady growth path",

Our operations are now expanded to over 2500 cities. In furniture décor business, which is led by Urban Ladder, that business also saw a very strong revenue growth over last year led by footfalls. Our flagship event drove revenues for the business with 30% growth Y-o-Y. And that happened through broad basic categories, including the bed, dining room living room, seating and essentials. So, as we look into the second half of the year, which is also marked by winter, which is very strong buying for north-east, west part of the country, also festivities in wedding season coming in we will ensure that the growth momentum for the business continues with a focus on number one to be looking at expansion of stores as well as digital commerce channels. We will be looking at continuing to onboard more and more merchants through a new commerce initiatives across the categories. Including increasing the share of wallet for all the onboarded merchants. Also, to continue to invest in supply chain capability which has been really a big enabler for all our stores and channels. And drive efficiencies. Also strengthen our capabilities in product development, which is really one of the big corner stone for our formats and strengthen applicability, which will be also supplemented by a lot of training efforts what we wish to undertake.

Sh Sanjay Roy 00:40:27 – 00:46:03 (Hydrocarbons - Exploration & Production) Good evening to everyone. Now, it was a solid quarter for the oil and gas business. As you can see, the QoQ EBIDTA is up by nearly 16% and the margins were up by 82.3% mainly on the back of higher gas price realisations and sustained production levels. The field performance has been very much in line with our expectations, which is a big positive. And, also in terms of higher exchange rates. So overall, we saw good growth in EBIDTA this quarter. With respect to the MJ gas condensate field project being pretty much on track, for the first gas production by the end of the year. The offshore installation campaign has been completed. So, the subsea production system has been installed. The Phase-II drilling and completion campaign is currently underway, and we've completed one well, then we are on track for completion on seven wells. Further, the FPSO has sailed from South Korea. It has been at the Kakinada outer anchorage. And, we have just finished sea-trials on that FPSO and now it's ready to sail in a few days towards the location. The next set of activities will include the hook-ups, the offshore testing, the pre-commissioning and commissioning, and thereafter the introduction of hydrocarbon for first gas production which is expected by the year end. So, just to give you a perspective on the gas market, and the LNG outlook. So, LNG markets remain quite tight despite supply of LNG being at the peak level. The shortfall in supplies due to the conflict still remains. © Reliance Industries Limited 2020 10 Consequently, we had seen prices go up to almost $98 per MMBTU, although, more or less, it has now settled at $45 per MMBTU and less",

The EU continues to refuse sourcing of gas from Russia and it may look at the European joint bids so that they do not have imbalance in pricing. Meanwhile, they are also looking at “Saving the gas for Safe Winter” and that policy is currently underway. Overall, Asian LNG continues to track the EU prices and as we don't expect any major capacities of LNG coming in before the 2026, we expect the markets to remain tight for LNG. In India, the gas market remains quite resilient. We have seen consumption of about 163 million cubic meters per day, during the quarter, which is slightly less, but then again, this may be due to the elevated costs and prices, particularly of LNG. Now, the LNG demand came down largely because of the production particularly from KG-D6 gas. In terms of prices, two things: one is the government announced the revised price for the second half of the year and revised it from $9.92 from the first half to $12 46 per million British thermal units for the second half. So, that implies that we should expect better realizations in the upcoming quarter. Meanwhile, there has been a committee formed under Dr. Kirit Parekh. And this committee is looking at natural gas pricing. It is represented by the upstream industry through AOGO. There is also a representation from the consumers and buyers. Potentially, the upstream producers, are saying that there should be marketing and pricing freedom, pursuant to the policies and the contracts",
    'So, that implies that we should expect better realizations in the upcoming quarter. Meanwhile, there has been a committee formed under Dr. Kirit Parekh. And this committee is looking at natural gas pricing. It is represented by the upstream industry through AOGO. There is also a representation from the consumers and buyers. Potentially, the upstream producers, are saying that there should be marketing and pricing freedom, pursuant to the policies and the contracts. The counter to elevated prices is increment to production, as we have seen in the case of KG-D6, and these investments will have to happen in frontier areas where there seems to be larger potential for such investments. You will need a huge scale of investments, billions of dollars, and for that to sustain, marketing and pricing freedom will be very important, particularly as costs are market driven. So, prices need to be similar. But as we are also seeing representation from the consumers who have been projecting that there needs to be some kind of cap, particularly in gas. So, we are still awaiting the recommendations. This is expected to come out in the next few weeks. Overall, the outlook for the gas, LNG looks quite tight in the near future, so we expect that the price realizations will remain firm. And with the augmentation of production from MJ field, we expect the earnings to go upwards. Thank you and very happy Diwali to all of you. © Reliance Industries Limited 2020 11 Sh V Srikanth 00:46:04 – 01:01:02 (O2C Business, Summary and Closure) Last section on O2C. Just two slides on how the energy markets were. You know, a lot of volatility. We have seen crude prices from $ 85-$ 125/bbl. LNG prices anywhere from $ 35 to $ 71/MMBtu. Crude prices this quarter eased due to record SPR releases from the US and increased output from Saudi Arabia and we saw that Russian supplies were fairly resilient.

    'Just two slides on how the energy markets were. You know, a lot of volatility. We have seen crude prices from $ 85-$ 125/bbl. LNG prices anywhere from $ 35 to $ 71/MMBtu. Crude prices this quarter eased due to record SPR releases from the US and increased output from Saudi Arabia and we saw that Russian supplies were fairly resilient. The LNG prices were very strong on the back of uncertainty over supply and strong demand. Ethane prices were actually lower; they were actually tracking the US gas, and weak petrochemicals demand. And also, US gas exports impacted due to extended outage at Freeport LNG terminal. Interestingly, from the refining side we saw everything, we saw historic rise in June to briefly negative territory this quarter. So overall it was about macro uncertainty, geopolitical uncertainty which was underpinning the energy markets. Go to the next slide please. Just the pictorial…and you can see the graph to the right of the dotted line is really tells you about the markets. You can see the fall in the prices of oil starting from $ 125 to much lower. Of course, on gas you see the other way around, but volatile, went up and you know, average much higher than previous quarter. Ethane prices sharp fall during the quarter. On the light distillate side again interesting, you saw $ 40 cracks and then almost zero. Mid distillates touching $ 75-plus, and then you know, trading around $ 40. Singapore refining complex $ 35 at one time, almost zero. So, this is the kind of environment in which the O2C business was operating in. Next slide please. And in that context, when you see revenues, and EBITDA about close to 12,000 crores it was on a year-on- year basis lower by 6% and a quarter-on-quarter by 40%. But when you look at EBITDA on a year-on-year basis, there was strength in mid-distillate cracks. It was however, offset by significant weakness in petrochemical margins. Of course, the fact that SAED related costs was very much there',

But when you look at EBITDA on a year-on-year basis, there was strength in mid-distillate cracks. It was however, offset by significant weakness in petrochemical margins. Of course, the fact that SAED related costs was very much there. It was about 4039 to this quarter. Had it not been for that the EBITDA would have been 11,968 plus 4039 crore. We also now look at petrochemical side, The margins declined anywhere between 15 to 30%. And on the back of subdued demand in both China and India, MEG was particularly weak. Also of course, in this quarter we also have the production meant for sale was lowered by 3.6% on a year-on- year basis, given the planned turnarounds in the refinery unit. on the Q-o-Q, the explanation for Q-o-Q is all about margins, lower fuel margins, lower downstream margins, and of course SAED remains a common factor for explanation for both year-on-year as well as quarter on quarter. © Reliance Industries Limited 2020 12 Next slide please. So, in this context, when you look at, these are the relevant demand parameters. You can see that oil demand strongly 1.2 million barrels per day and this is on the back of opening up, removing of all the curbs, and importantly, gas to oil switching and, because gas prices were so high, demand was strong. On the polymer and polyester side, you can see the percentages between 1% to 2% - stable I would say. You know we saw stable demand in almost every use within agriculture, health, and consumer durables, we saw it everywhere. Growth rates were small, but demand was stable',
    "You can see that oil demand strongly 1.2 million barrels per day and this is on the back of opening up, removing of all the curbs, and importantly, gas to oil switching and, because gas prices were so high, demand was strong. On the polymer and polyester side, you can see the percentages between 1% to 2% - stable I would say. You know we saw stable demand in almost every use within agriculture, health, and consumer durables, we saw it everywhere. Growth rates were small, but demand was stable. Operating rates both for cracker as well as refining, did see a pickup, on the strength on the basis that the middle distillate cracks was strong, and so people are using production to the maximum extent possible. So, in this backdrop here supply was possible because of the increased utilization. Specifically, an oil demand, you know, 10% growth on a year-on-year basis, gasoline demand up 9% on the back of automobile sales, tourism you're seeing that. On high-speed diesel that was also up 11% because, economic activity was normalized. We saw farm demand also as one of the reasons we also saw commercial vehicle sale increase, all of them explaining the HSD’s demand. ATF was the percentage terms sharply up 64%, however, as you know, it was coming off a lower base. Load factors definitely in September was 84% was well about the 73% in ’21. So yeah, that is the demand side. And when you look at demand in Polymer and Polyester, you know I talked about the 1% growth in Polymer. This was more led by PVC we saw strong growth 10% up. However, both PP, PE was impacted by low demand in EU and US, and some of the applications of PP. Also, there was there were outages in one Indian producer and therefore that did impact demand. Polyester side 2% up. We saw good growth in PET up 11%, and also staple fibre, but the PFY was low. So, there was stable domestic consumption",
    "And when you look at demand in Polymer and Polyester, you know I talked about the 1% growth in Polymer. This was more led by PVC we saw strong growth 10% up. However, both PP, PE was impacted by low demand in EU and US, and some of the applications of PP. Also, there was there were outages in one Indian producer and therefore that did impact demand. Polyester side 2% up. We saw good growth in PET up 11%, and also staple fibre, but the PFY was low. So, there was stable domestic consumption. This is where you can see a very sharp fall and you know some of the explanation for why earnings were weak in growth that much even on our quarter-on-quarter basis as well as on year-on-year basis. So, you look at polymer deltas anywhere down on a quarter-on-quarter basis between 12% and 26% - PP, PE, PVC all of them. And the point being that Polymer prices were lower between 17% and 30%. And that prices on an absolute price softness were way beyond the input price, which is naphtha, which was down 19% on a Q-o-Q that's essentially affecting margins. Also, the some of the improvement in the in the debottlenecking of logistics and freight etc also meant that it resulted in lower realization On the polyester delta side chain that has been broadly flat as you can see $ 600 per ton and their waste saw margins on downstream was up 25%-30% but really offset by weak PTA and MEG margins. So that's something that, you know, we saw that for overall didn't change. PX margins firmed as integrated players like us optimized PX production to capture higher gasoline margin. So, we did that. So overall, that's a lot of impact on deltas, and its implication therefore on the overall EBITDA. © Reliance Industries Limited 2020 13 Next slide. On the transportation fuel side as you can see demand for gasoil was up for this quarter. Now these explanations are you can see on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Overall, we did see a fall in cracks from $ 52 to $ 42",

On the transportation fuel side as you can see demand for gasoil was up for this quarter. Now these explanations are you can see on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Overall, we did see a fall in cracks from $ 52 to $ 42. But it still it has remained broadly elevated because of the gas to oil switching that I talked about. Fact that even inventories, while it is gone up, it is significantly below the five-year averages and also China export quota also eased some of the supply constraints. So that's what we see. Year-on-year you can see that $ 8 for gasoil became $ 41. So that also explains why the overall fall in margins, rather the EBITDA earnings is much more muted on a year-on-year basis. Similarly, on ATF / Kero, we didn't see a sharp growth, almost 1 million barrels per day, and primarily I would say it is in Asia Pacific. Cracks remained elevated but declined on a quarter-on-quarter basis. So, most of these margins have remained strong but on sequential basis is lower. So that is to explain why Q-o-Q was also low. Next. On gasoline side as you can see demand strong, almost 2 million barrels of which half of them was here in Asia Pacific, but again cracks if you will see $ 30 becoming almost $ 9. And that is because US demand was not up to the expectations on the back of a petrol price at the pump level and lower discretionary spending. We also saw that the fact that because gasoline was much in demand, refinery utilization rates that we saw earlier on meant higher gasoline supply. So that put pressure on gasoline. And the fact that tanker rates continue to be high had an impact on the inventory levels that were being held and therefore it pressurized cracks",

And the fact that tanker rates continue to be high had an impact on the inventory levels that were being held and therefore it pressurized cracks. On the operating rates I mentioned about low throughputs that is on the back of both planed turnarounds in both the primary and secondary units of SEZ for maintenance and inspection. We did increase naphtha sourcing to capture reforming margins, because as we saw gasoline was good at the earlier part of this quarter. And we focused on maximizing gasoil exports given the demand. Aromatic production again, we rationalized that in favour of gasoline given the economics. Thanks to the fact that the gasifiers performed very well meant that we didn't have to import any kind of LNG, therefore keep a control on the costs. Next slide please. The last slide on the O2C business. So, we do expect demand to continue to be strong this year, which is almost 2 million barrels increase on a year-on-year basis. And the all the sanctions and all that will mean that in as far as some of the products are concerned Asian and Middle East refiners could benefit a bit there. Margin environment middle distillate definitely given that gas prices will continue to be in demand and the polymer margins we are looking forward to it improving. You know as and when China opens, because the feedstock prices are being pretty attractive or for conversion. © Reliance Industries Limited 2020 14 On the demand side. Again, opening up means fuel demand is good. Gas to oil switching continues to be a factor everywhere and more so as winter setting and festive season, which we are seeing now in this quarter should benefit",
    "You know as and when China opens, because the feedstock prices are being pretty attractive or for conversion. © Reliance Industries Limited 2020 14 On the demand side. Again, opening up means fuel demand is good. Gas to oil switching continues to be a factor everywhere and more so as winter setting and festive season, which we are seeing now in this quarter should benefit. On the challenges side, as you know, overall GDP growth weakness, inflation, monetary policy, interest costs all of them you know are definitely areas of concern and rates continue to remain higher and the Chinese export quota means that it keeps the market supplied in as far as margins are concerned. Really to summarize, given this backdrop and the whole set of slides, which I talked about, including what Sanjay talked about on LNG environment, the kind of volatility, in that context, I think the performance, it's a strong performance, it's a resilient performance, given the kind of volatility, macro as well as energy. And, you know, I had mentioned that consolidated EBITDA for quarter 2 to an aggregate was 34,663 crore means a growth of 14.5%. Had it not been for SAED related cost, which is Rs 4039 crores, the growth in EBITDA would have been almost 28% Higher. And this would have also translated to a healthy net profit growth on a year-on-year basis. However, I would say that given that equal mix now that we have between consumer business and energy, we have been able to weather this volatility pretty well. You saw in the Gaurav’s presentation on Retail, the store expansion that we saw the omni-channel retail strategy, you know, the footfalls, the digital channels that are, all of them are kicking in very well. Similarly, on the on Jio side customer addition, almost 7.7 million customers in this quarter. The improvement in the customer engagement metrics remained very good. And Kiran talked about the 5G services and why the standalone provides us with a lot of opportunity to grow",

And Sanjay talked about the KGD6, the MJ field commissioning by year-end mean that currently we are at 20% of production, we can be at 30% of India's gas production. And also, the fact that prices will be higher. Let me take this opportunity to thank you all and wish you all a very very Happy Deepawali. Thank you so much. © Reliance Industries Limited 2020 15"

Consolidated R&D investment for first quarter was at Rs. 4,608 million compared to Rs. 5,926 million for first quarter last year.

With this, I would like to leave the floor open for questions. Thank you. Moderator: We will begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from the line of Kunal Dhamesha from Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead. Kunal Dhamesha: The first one on Taro. Is that any one-off related to integration cost in the SG&A expense for Q1? Dilip S. Shanghvi: For Taro we cannot give information beyond whatever Taro has shared. So sorry, but I can't respond. Kunal Dhamesha: Second one on psoriatic arthritis trial. We were looking at some revised timelines on that because some centers I think there were some issues and we were looking at new centers. So, all those has been figured out or is it still ongoing, any timeline in terms of when that trial can get completed? Dilip S. Shanghvi: We have not given guidelines of the completion of the trial, but the challenges in both Ukraine and Russia have contributed to potential delay. Kunal Dhamesha: But, does it also affect our US timeline for that product? Dilip S. Shanghvi: This product is in a multi-centre global trial. Based on which then we will file in all the markets, so it will effect. Kunal Dhamesha: So, to that extent, if we are not able to solve that or till the Russia-Ukraine thing is now basically normalized? Dilip S. Shanghvi: They have to make up for that in some other country",

Dilip S. Shanghvi: We are addressing the issue. Moderator: Thank you. Next question is from line of Prakash Agarwal from Axis Capital. Please go ahead. Prakash Agarwal: My question is on the cost, which is staff and SG&A ex-R&D. So, both these places, there has been double digit growth both YoY and QoQ. So, is it a function of currency or inflation or increased promotion both in India and US, if you could just give some color and is it here to stay? C.S. Muralidharan: So, as far as expenses is concerned, we have already said that it will be inching up as the operations normalize across the markets, and with the increase in sales in India what we witnessed and also in our global revenues and normalized operations, these expenses increased to the current level and there is no specific forex related component including that. Prakash Agarwal: But only because of India or there are promotionals which is - C.S. Muralidharan: This is across markets',

Prakash Agarwal: So, these are all base level cost increases which are here to stay, there's no one- off as such? C.S.

So, if you could give more details, why we are seeing that kind of timing issue, that would be very helpful? Dilip S.

Damayanti Kerai: My question is on Cequa. So, post entry of generic for Restisis, have you seen any change in market dynamics for pricing or prescription pickup for the branded products including your Cequa brand? Abhay Gandhi: Not really. If you see the market share, even post-launch of the generic, we've been able to ensure an increase in market share. So, we are able to navigate through the situation. Damayanti Kerai: Anything on the pricing part or similar as compared to the generic entry? Abhay Gandhi: So, all segments of business put together, I don't see a negative impact on the pricing.

Please go ahead. Neha Manpuria: Abhay, on Winlevi, if I were to look at the prescription data, there seems to be some sort of a stabilization after the initial momentum that we saw in the product? Has there been any change in the promotion that is leading to this and what's your view on Winlevi contribution meaningfully sort of increasing to the fatality sales that we are reporting, any sense there? Abhay Gandhi: If I look at the data, I see quarter-on-quarter, we have grown by nearly 22%. So I don't know why you say that there has been a slowdown. Neha Manpuria: No, I'm looking at it more in the last six, nine weeks probably. Abhay Gandhi: Don't forget that these are also the summer months where derm products generally slow down a bit. So therefore, if you're looking at six, eight weeks, nine weeks kind of period, you are right. But I look at it on a quarter-on-quarter basis, even in a slow quarter, if we have grown by 22%, that's a reasonable number. Neha Manpuria: And there is no change in promotions in Winlevi since our launch, right? Abhay Gandhi: When you say change, I mean, there is nothing which is a negative. Of course, we will keep looking at what is it that we learn about the product as we promote and make improvements as we go along. So, the change will always be there, but it's a change for the better is what we hope",

Neha Manpuria: In terms of contribution of Winlevi when do you think you have adequate formulary coverage to start seeing in Winlevi contribution? I know it's too difficult to sort of spell that down, but in your view, what is your assessment based on your conversation with the firm release? Abhay Gandhi: So, product wise you know we don't give the split, but we have always been very positive and optimistic about Winlevi and otherwise, you would not have had 10,000 doctors in some seven, eight months prescribing the product. And we continue to invest on the product and with the hope that it will be important contributor to the overall business. Moderator: Next question is from the line of Krish Mehta from Enam Holdings.

C.S. Muralidharan: So other income by definition is not very core to overall our business. It comprises various moving parts, including fair valuation of investments, certain treasury income across multiple geographies, which do fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter",
    "C.S. Muralidharan: So other income by definition is not very core to overall our business. It comprises various moving parts, including fair valuation of investments, certain treasury income across multiple geographies, which do fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. So, I think in our view, comparison strictly on a quarter-on-quarter may not be correct. Krish Mehta: I was actually looking at it over the last 16 quarters and we've always tended to be above Rs.100 crores. And given it was Rs.2 crores, I was wondering if there's a one-off and if there's a trend? C.S. Muralidharan: There is no one-off. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Sameer Baisiwala from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Sameer Baisiwala: Abhay, first question is on Pentasa. So, a good launch. This is 1Q results capture full three months impact including launch inventory, or was it less? Abhay Gandhi: This captures the whole quarter. Sameer Baisiwala: You launched in the middle of May. So therefore, I – Abhay Gandhi: You're talking the approval period. We launched it in the month of May actually. So, it's one and a half months sales roughly that we were able to capture. Sameer Baisiwala: And plus some launch inventory, no? Abhay Gandhi: What do you exactly mean by launch inventory? We didn't stock up the distributors if that's the question, did we like stock it up, no. Sameer Baisiwala: The second question is on Winlevi. First is on the expansion of the deal to newer markets. So if you can just tell us how much regulatory work needs to be done here and how meaningful can this be just qualitatively if you can?

Shanghvi: I think regulatory work in different countries are different. In some countries, we just have to file the existing product with the existing studies. In some countries, we have to do some kind of Phase-4 stability study or those kinds of things. Especially in Japan, I think we will have to run the Phase-2, Phase-3 for sure. Sameer Baisiwala: So it's fair to say that it would be at least one year before the approval cycle begins in these new markets? Dilip S. Shanghvi: Minimum, because many countries have approval cycle of two years. Sameer Baisiwala: Just for the US market for Winlevi, Abhay, would it be fair to say that a large part of the prescriptions being generated are under co-pay scheme and smaller portions being getting reimbursed? Abhay Gandhi: You can say that, though remember, co-pay also leads to a realization, so it's not exactly like free. But we are increasingly seeing that a lot of our prescriptions are actually going through the payer system even without contracting. So that's very useful because it shows that doctors are interested enough in the product to take the effort of raising prior authorizations. Sameer Baisiwala: But including that also what's going directly through payers, but still larger part is co-pay and of course you get some money but it's just barely about covers because maybe little bit margin no? Abhay Gandhi: Let me just say that if everything goes to the payor system, I will be the happiest person",

Sameer Baisiwala: On Levulan, when you see, Abhay, the sales getting restored back to pre- COVID levels? Abhay Gandhi: Very difficult question to answer because if I see in the US, even today, the social distancing norms… and I'm talking in clinic, not in the outside world, how many patients are taken up in a day and all that is much lower than what it used to be in the pre-COVID times. So, to that extent, the throughput per doctor has definitely come down. Having said that, the number of doctors who are now doing PDT therapy has increased from what it used to be like a year or two years ago.

Moderator: Next question is from the line of Surya Patra from Phillip Capital. Please go ahead. Surya Patra: So, just first on the Alchemee.

    "Moderator: Next question is from the line of Surya Patra from Phillip Capital. Please go ahead. Surya Patra: So, just first on the Alchemee. Since it has been integrated, and it has obviously had implication on the staff cost rise, other expenses rise and all that, and this quarter we have seen kind of a meaningful underperformance at Taro end also. So just to understand a bit, whether this is a kind of profit making company or it is a loss-making company or what is the kind of profitability of its portfolio that has been added, some sense on that if you can give it will be helpful? C.S. Muralidharan: I think beyond what Taro has disclosed, we'll be unable to furnish any further information on Alchemee acquisition. Surya Patra: Second question is on the Revlimid. So, now are you in a position to give the launch timeline for this? Secondly, on this, do you think the competitive intensity could be higher than what it was earlier expected among the first launch play, because what we are seeing that although it is a volume limited kind of condition that is there for everybody day, but in case of Teva, it seems a double digit percentage of volume there they have done post-launch. So, do you see the condition of limited volume one is not so rigid, and people can do more than what it is when mentioned in the terms? Abhay Gandhi: I think every company has its own different contract and agreement with the innovator. So once you are bound by a contract, you abide by it. So I think that's a simple answer to your question. Even we will abide by whatever we have committed in our contract. So I think that should answer the latter part of your question. As to the first part, internally, I am clear when we would be likely to launch, but on our calls, we don't give product wise details when exactly we are launching. That's also competitive information. Surya Patra: Last question on the sales force addition. So we had indicated around 10% kind of rise in the current financial year",

Please go ahead. Dhara Patwa: I have a question regarding Ilumya. Since the trials are ongoing for psoriatic arthritis, so how does the pricing differ -- do we keep the same pricing as per the current indication of psoriasis or the pricing differ for different indication? Dilip S. Shanghvi: Pricing for every product is a function of appropriately choosing the price, which will allow you to get appropriate reimbursement as well as accessing different formularies. So, it's difficult to respond today because it's better to take those decisions closer to the market. And we have to remain competitive with whatever the pricing for IL-23 for that indication would be at that point of time so that we can get good acceptance. Dhara Patwa: Sir, will it be fair to assume that whatever the competitors are offering will be more or less 10%, 20% at that range? Dilip S",

Dhara Patwa: I wanted CAPEX guidance for FY23. Dilip S. Shanghvi: We have not given any specific guidance, but we have no major investment. However, in any case, some kind of debottlenecking or minor upgradation, we would generally spend a few hundred crores every year. Moderator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Nimish Mehta from Research Delta Advisors. Please go ahead. Nimish Mehta: Just one question on Halol. Is it fair to assume that we've been able to shift all the injectable approvals that were held up at Halol to other facility or it's still work-in progress, how do we look at it? Dilip S. Shanghvi: We've not responded to the issue specifically about Halol. We hope that we should get approval once we will get the EIR.

So, just wanted to get your view on the Sitagliptin genericization. What is the ground level understanding as of today? I mean, I understand that it might be a little bit early to comment, because the market formation is yet to happen, the transition is taking place. So just wanted to get your view, like what do you see as the upside to the overall transition, any particular risk that we are seeing right now, and which particular molecule should be possibly more at risk in terms of gliptins or would it be more towards Glimepride, any thoughts on the transition? Kirti Ganorkar: It's a very broad question about Sitagliptin marketing. So, what I can say is that the patent got just expired on 5th July. So, we are too early to the market. And as of today, as I understand that there are 25 companies which has launched the generic products and the pricing is in the range of Rs. 9-10 for 50 milligrams. And the market dynamics is very competitive. So, everyone is trying to get market share out of what market share Sun has or Merck had in the past. So, we have about 33% market share and our objective is, even post-patent expiry, how do we protect our market share and grow over that. That's what we can say. The other question was how the PP4 like Sitagliptin will impact other therapy areas, is very difficult to say. Maybe after one or two quarters, we will have more clarity on how it is impacting the other therapies",

If I look at your specialty business, the quarterly run rate that has crossed our targeted annual rate of around $750 million, if I remember it correctly, so would you like to revise your target here and what we should expect in FY23, FY24 and FY25 from this piece of business?

Muralidharan: So, at the outset, we want to clarify that we have not given any annual target or guidance of global specialty sales. So I think it's important to realize that. As such, we have not given any guidance on any specific individual business. Naushad Chaudhary: So in terms of growth rate, should we expect this kind of momentum to continue in this business?

Naushad Chaudhary: Lastly, in terms of our exceptional costs and provision, if I see last four or five years, the quantum has been quite high versus in this quarter. I don't see there is much of that. So going forward, should we expect the magnitude of that should come down significantly? C.S.

Sameer Baisiwala: A question on India business. When you do go down to smaller cities and towns, any thoughts that you can share, what is the limiting factor for you to drive growth, is it the less healthcare infrastructure or doctors, just your thoughts on that would be great? Dilip S. Shanghvi: Sameer, what is the question? Sameer Baisiwala: So, the question is since to drive India growth, we're trying to geographically expand which I read as going into smaller towns and cities. So when you are doing that, now at a larger scale, what do you think is the key limiting factor for you to expand your business? Dilip S. Shanghvi: Actually, I don't understand the question. What is the limiting factor means? We remain very positive about our India business to be able to continue to grow",

But Kirti can explain. Kirti Ganorkar: I think what you're assuming is we are going into rural markets and smaller towns, that's not correct. When we are saying, we are expanding, it's not necessarily we are expanding into smaller towns and rural areas. There is a lot of expansion is happening in metros and tier-1, tier-2 cities. Sameer Baisiwala: Okay, that's fine, sir. I will maybe take it offline. And the other question is, is there any update on the biosimilars? I think you had mentioned a few quarters back, that you'd be commencing work on this. Dilip S. Shanghvi: We also said at that time, that we are looking at products in the third wave of approvals, in the sense, that we want to be in time for the launch along with patent expiry, but products that are likely to be going off-patent in the third wave. So that I think that we are pursuing. Sameer Baisiwala: Still early days? Okay, that's fine. Sir, I'm little confused about the Taro's results. And I know you're not taking any questions on that. But I will just express what's going on in my mind",
    "So that I think that we are pursuing. Sameer Baisiwala: Still early days? Okay, that's fine. Sir, I'm little confused about the Taro's results. And I know you're not taking any questions on that. But I will just express what's going on in my mind. And they don't do a call. So, unfortunately, we can't ask anyone else. So the small point here is that if I see pre-Alchemee and post-Alchemee, full quarter impact, the sales has just grown about $15 million, or something like that, and the cost has gone up just the SG&A anywhere 30 million, so it's almost a big negative factor. That's one. And second, my understanding was, I think, 2021 full year, Alchemee's total sales was more like $161, $170 million. So actually, on a quarter basis, it should be a much higher number to begin with. So, I'm just wondering whether this Taro's result is a business as usual or it's going to get better as we go forward? Dilip S. Shanghvi: I think, you started the question in a way which I think you understand that. Difficult to share beyond whatever that we have shared and I understand the challenge that you have in terms of putting a certain kind of model. However, I think, if you look at it in a positive way, then in spite of a loss of potential profit in Taro of almost $30 million, we've grown profitability. So I think philosophically, we're looking at that in our business there will be challenges in product or in some subset of business, how do we find a way to make up for that challenge as a company overall in the business and that's how we want to run the business on a long-term basis.

Please go ahead. Kunal Dhamesha: This one is on Winlevi. So given Winlevi was already approved at the time of North America in-licensing agreement, did that agreement included some form of initial inventory to be transferred to Sun Pharma? Abhay Gandhi: Sorry, what is the question -- initial inventory? Kunal Dhamesha: Yes, so I mean, the upfront payment of 45 million in the agreement would have also included some kind of inventory because it was already approved product and we were about to launch. Abhay Gandhi: Whatever we have disclosed is disclosed. There is nothing on inventory that I can specifically answer to. It was not a marketed product, that's where you're going, it was an approved product, but not a marketed product. Kunal Dhamesha: So the supply would have only started just before the -? Dilip S. Shanghvi: You have to understand that the product came with Sun label. Abhay Gandhi: It was produced for Sun after the agreement was signed in a certain transition period that we had agreed to. So there was no buying over or something of an existing inventory, if that's way you're going with this question. Moderator: Next question is from Prakash Agarwal from Axis Capital Limited.

Prakash Agarwal: If I've seen the IPM for last 10-year growth, 5%, 6% has been volume growth 3% price and 3% new product. If you see the last three, five year trend ex-COVID also, the volume has come down to 2%, 3%. My sense is there is some impact from trade generics and private labels, which is eating some volume share. What is your view going ahead that this is going to continue and increase and what is our strategy to combat that? Kirti Ganorkar: In my view, we are growing well both by volume and value also.

I do a discussion with the regulatory authority and what thought process we are using price increase, I mean, everybody's taken price increase, but for the core portfolio essential product list, what is your sense on the price rationalization which might come?

Please go ahead. Alok Dalal: Dilipbhai, when do you expect Ilumya approval in China and the African market? Dilip S. Shanghvi: I think we've shared with you the date on which we have filed the Chinese product because it needed to do some clinical studies and all of that. But, it's difficult to predict. There is a certain amount of process that we need to follow. Hopefully, we should be able to close all these issues in 12-months. But I'm not predicting that we will launch the product in that time because regulatory issues, difficult to predict till we get the approval. Alok Dalal: On the African market? Dilip S. Shanghvi: Which African market? We have not said anything about any African market. Alok Dalal: I thought there is the partnership with Hikma. Dilip S. Shanghvi: That's mainly for GCC countries. Alok Dalal: Also, on the specialty side, do you think that pipeline products are large enough now to help sustain the base? The question that I'm trying to ask is that the specialty business has become pretty large and as years pass, some products will reach the maturity stage. So, do you think the pipeline is good enough for you to continue that momentum going or in-licensing becomes a big part of that? Dilip S. Shanghvi: So I think we've always said that filing our own new product, at the same time looking at opportunities inorganic, both licensing as well as acquisition is something which will continue to help us expand our specialty business",

Dilip S. Shanghvi: That's a reasonable expectation. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Saion Mukherjee from Nomura. Please go ahead. Saion Mukherjee: I just have one question for Abhay on Ilumya. Abhay, you mentioned I think a few calls back, COVID sort of had a negative impact. Now, we are seeing the traction coming through, the product has been in the market for some time, there is enough data, formulary access, etc., has improved. So how are you thinking about growth for Ilumya in the US, will there be a spurt in growth in the sense that we will see an acceleration or it would be a gradual steady rise in market share? Abhay Gandhi: It's more an expectation of how Ilumya will grow, is part of our total guidance. So I think I have nothing specific to add on the product question. Saion Mukherjee: I was not asking for this year’s guidance, like more from a two, three perspective? Abhay Gandhi: So any product in chronic segment doesn't really see its burst as such. So therefore, I wouldn't want to classify and give you any kind of an answer, which even suggest that",

    "Unfortunately, Mr. Milind Lakkad – our Chief HR Officer could not join us today due to a bereavement in his family. Our management team will give a brief overview of the company’s performance, followed by a Q&A session. As you are aware, we do not provide specific revenue or earnings guidance. And anything said on this call which reflects our outlook for the future. or which could be construed as a forward-looking statement, must be reviewed in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. We have outlined these risks in the second slide of the quarterly fact sheet available on our website and mailed out to those who have subscribed to our mailing list. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Rajesh. Rajesh Gopinathan: Thank you, Kedar, and good morning, good afternoon and good evening to all of you. We are starting out in FY 23 on a strong note, growing 16.2% in rupee terms, 15.5% in constant currency terms and 10.2% in dollar terms. : Page 1 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) We announced our salary increases with effect from April 1st. Reflecting that and other employee costs we incurred in Q1, our operating margin for the quarter was at 23.1%, a contraction of 1.9% sequentially and 2.4% year-on-year. Net margin was at 18%. I will now invite Samir and NGS to go over different aspects of our performance during the quarter. I'll step in again later to provide some more color on the demand trends that we're seeing. Over to you, Samir. Samir Seksaria: Thank you, Rajesh. Let me first walk you through the headline number. In the first quarter of FY 23 our revenue grew 15.5% YoY on a constant currency basis. Reported revenue in INR was `527.58 billion, a year-on-year growth of 16.2%. In dollar terms, revenue was $6.78 billion, a year-on-year growth of 10.2%. Let me now go over the financials",

Reported revenue in INR was `527.58 billion, a year-on-year growth of 16.2%. In dollar terms, revenue was $6.78 billion, a year-on-year growth of 10.2%. Let me now go over the financials. As Rajesh mentioned, we announced salary increases of 5% to 8% and much higher for top performers with effect from April 1. This had a 1.5% impact on operating margins. Continued supply side challenges entailed additional expenses, such as backfilling expenses and higher subcontractor usage. This and normalizing travel expenses negated various operational efficiencies, resulting in an operating margin of 23.1%, a sequential contraction of 1.9%. Net income margin was at 18%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.5% and our accounts receivable was at 63 day sales outstanding in dollar terms, down one day compared to Q4. Net cash from operations was ₹108.1 billion, which is a cash conversion of 114%. Free cash flows were ₹100.68 billion. Invested funds as on 30th June stood at ₹527.6 billion, and the board has recommended an interim dividend of ₹8 per share. Since Milind is not here today, I will take you through the HR numbers now. On the people front, our workforce strength crossed the 600,000 mark this quarter, ending this quarter with 606,331 employees. We continue to hire talent from across the world, with a net addition of 14,136. It is a very diverse workforce with 153 nationalities represented and with the women making up 35.5% of the base. We remain committed to investing in organic talent development towards building the next generation G&T workforce. In Q1, TCSers clocked 12 million learning hours, resulting in the acquisition of 1.7 million competencies",

In Q1, TCSers clocked 12 million learning hours, resulting in the acquisition of 1.7 million competencies. LTM attrition in IT services was at 19.7%, and we think it will rise further in Q2, after which it should start tapering. Now over to you, NGS, for some color on our segments and products and platforms. N G Subramaniam: Thank you, Samir. Let me walk you through our segmental performance details for the quarter. All the growth numbers are on year-on-year constant currency basis. : Page 2 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) All our verticals showed good growth in Q1. Growth was led by Retail and CPG which grew 25.1% after a similar strong growth last quarter, Communications and Media grew 19.6%, while the Manufacturing as well as Technology & Services verticals both grew 16.4%. BFSI, our largest vertical, grew 13.9% while Life Sciences and healthcare grew by 11.9%. By geography, growth was led by North America which grew 19.1%. UK grew 12.6%, while continental Europe grew 12.1%. In emerging markets, India grew by 20.8%, Asia Pacific grew 6.2%, Latin America by 21.6% and Middle East and Africa grew by 3.2%. Our portfolio of products and platforms continue to do well. ignio™, our cognitive automation software suite signed up 28 new customers and five clients went live during the quarter. In addition, 15 existing clients acquired new licenses of the suite during the quarter. TCS filed three patents around ignio during the quarter and was granted one.

A global luxury hotel brand has deployed ignio AIOps to manage digital assets, including hotel content and promotional offers published globally for thousands of its properties across many brands. The solution detects anomalies in the properties across all brands, eliminates noise and averts outages in reservation and offers, thereby enhancing customer experience and averting loss of business. TCS BaNCS™, our flagship product suite in the financial services domain had three new wins and four go lives during the quarter. I'm very pleased to share that in the recently published IBS Intelligence Sales League Table 2022, TCS was ranked number one in investment and fund management and in fraud management; and number two worldwide in the areas of insurtech, Islamic banking, wholesale banking, treasury and capital markets. Our Banking Service Bureau in Israel, which powers the country's first digital only bank has won a second client.

The Quartz Smart Solution for Bond Issuance is now live at one of the leading central securities depositories in India. It facilitates real-time exchange of information among multiple stakeholders, like issuers, trustees, credit rating agencies, depositories and stock exchanges on a private permissioned blockchain platform. The solution helps eliminate potential double counting of underlying assets and ensures greater transparency and governance in the bond issuance lifecycle. In Life Sciences, our award-winning advanced drug development suite had one new win, our first client for this suite in Japan. Our HOBS™ suite of solutions for communication service provider had one new win and four go lives in Q1. We also launched a new release of HOBS™ Business Assurance, which enables clients to deploy faster and more easily integrate with real-time data sources, visualize revenue leakages and take corrective actions in near real-time. TCS TwinX™, our AI-based digital twin solution had one win during this quarter and one client went live.

TCS National Qualifier Test, which is gaining traction as the preferred entry level hiring platform for corporate India has made significant progress over the last one year with over 900 corporate partners at the end of Q1. Let me now cover our client metrics. Movement of clients up the revenue bands is a clear demonstration of our customer- centric strategy at work. By providing a great experience and building transformational solutions that deliver high impact outcomes, we gain goodwill and trust which translates into a steady broadening and deepening of our relationships with our clients. In Q1, we had robust client additions in every revenue bucket compared to the year ago period. We added nine more clients in the $100 million+ band, bringing the total to 59. We added 19 more clients in the $50 million+ band bringing the total to 124. We added 31 more clients to the $20 million+ band, bringing the total to 272. We added 41 : Page 4 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) more clients in the $10 million+ band bringing the total to 446. We added 64 more clients in the $5 million+ band, bringing the total to 650. We added 78 more clients in the $1 million+ band, bringing the total to 1,196. Over to you, Rajesh, to give your insights on demand drivers during the quarter. Rajesh Gopinathan: Thank you, NGS.

    'We added 64 more clients in the $5 million+ band, bringing the total to 650. We added 78 more clients in the $1 million+ band, bringing the total to 1,196. Over to you, Rajesh, to give your insights on demand drivers during the quarter. Rajesh Gopinathan: Thank you, NGS. All the demand drivers we have been speaking about for the last two years continue to be very much in play. In Q1, we saw plenty of deals in each of these categories, be it cloud adoption, operating model transformation, vendor consolidations, or G&T engagements. Cloud adoption continues to be a powerful growth driver. We have plenty of deals this quarter once again and more in the pipeline. Our strong partnerships with the hyper scalers, deep expertise on their platforms, and our industry-specific solutions and domain knowledge have helped us gain share in this space. As you might have seen already, we won four Global Partner of the Year Awards and two Regional Partner Awards from Microsoft this quarter. Prior to that, we won two Partner of the Year Awards from Google Cloud. The full list is published in our earnings press release available on our website. Let me now spend a little bit of time on the operations transformation opportunity, which is a big contributor to our revenue growth, order book and pipeline. We see three distinct trends here. • There are more and more clients looking to leverage next-generation technologies to create leaner, agile, resilient and efficient operation with an intent to plow back the savings into the business transformation initiatives. We have been big beneficiaries of this trend. A game changer has been TCS Cognix™, our AI-driven human machine collaboration suite, which we launched in 2020. It features a large number of pre-built configurable and reusable digital solutions, covering a wide range of industries and business function. Today, the suite consists of 530 value builders, covering an extensive set of business and technology use cases',
    "We have been big beneficiaries of this trend. A game changer has been TCS Cognix™, our AI-driven human machine collaboration suite, which we launched in 2020. It features a large number of pre-built configurable and reusable digital solutions, covering a wide range of industries and business function. Today, the suite consists of 530 value builders, covering an extensive set of business and technology use cases. Over 267 customers have leveraged Cognix™ across business and operations to drive business outcomes. In Q1, we had six new wins featuring Cognix™. • The second trend is the growing incidence of multi services integrated deals. By bringing multiple elements of the operation stack, such as business processes, applications, databases, operating systems and underlying infrastructure, all within the scope of a single service provider, clients are not : Page 5 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) only able to drive greater accountability, but also take up transformation programs that are more holistic in nature. This trend plays to our strengths in terms of our structure, as well as our ability to bring together different capabilities from across TCS to create a seamless service delivery team. We have six new multi service integrated deals in Q1 versus two to three deals per quarter in FY'22. • An adjunct to these two trends is that clients are looking to reduce complexity by bringing down the number of service providers they work with to a few select partners who possess the right innovation capabilities and can scale. We won several large deals in Q1 which were vendor consolidation exercises. Let me switch gears and talk about the airline industry which is no stranger to consolidation. There is an industry level transformation taking place there, designed to make airlines much more competitive and customer-centric, and TCS is playing a big role in helping industry players transform",
    'We won several large deals in Q1 which were vendor consolidation exercises. Let me switch gears and talk about the airline industry which is no stranger to consolidation. There is an industry level transformation taking place there, designed to make airlines much more competitive and customer-centric, and TCS is playing a big role in helping industry players transform. The airline industry is heavily dependent on ticketing platforms whose legacy proprietary models restrict airlines’ ability to offer new products and services in a direct- to-consumer or B2C model. This is preventing them from establishing competitive differentiation and is resulting in an opportunity loss. To address this problem, the International Air Transportation Association or IATA, has come up with a new open standard called New Distribution Capabilities, or NDC, which airlines can use to dynamically create personalized offers for customers. This enables a customer-specific bundling of preferences, such as number of check-in bags, seat choices, in-flight amenities, refreshments, or even in-flight shopping, priced uniquely for sale through their own channels or through third-party aggregators and travel agents. TCS is currently engaged with three airlines in implementing NDC, and in discussion with a couple more. For a leading UK-based carrier, which is an early adopter of this initiative, TCS did the end-to-end business process redesign and solution development for NDC adoption. Since deployment, the airlines NDC channel daily bookings have grown 500%, contributing to more than 20% of the overall indirect bookings and helping the airline become a digital retailer and personalize the customers experience and drive new revenues',

Moving on to the next theme of how TCS is helping clients adopt innovative technology- enabled business models that drive new revenue streams, let me share two examples: : Page 6 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) • TCS has partnered with a senior care of a leading US-based provider of long- term care insurance in launching a new line of business and assisted living marketplace. The platform will allow seekers of long-term care to find the closest assisted living care providers and also offer subscription-based consultation. Using design thinking approach, TCS helped define the product roadmap and carved a playbook for product positioning and targeting customer base in competitive market. The new marketplace will be formally launched this month and is targeting million customers over the next three years. In addition to driving new subscription-based revenues, the platform will allow the parent company to embed its insurance product in every transaction in the marketplace. • Similarly, a large Fortune 500 electric gas utility has launched a new business model to generate a new revenue stream based on home energy services, that is providing warranty repair, refurbishment and replacement services of home appliances, such as air conditioners, washing machines and refrigerators. It partnered with TCS to build the platform needed to enable the service delivery that is central to this new business',
    '• Similarly, a large Fortune 500 electric gas utility has launched a new business model to generate a new revenue stream based on home energy services, that is providing warranty repair, refurbishment and replacement services of home appliances, such as air conditioners, washing machines and refrigerators. It partnered with TCS to build the platform needed to enable the service delivery that is central to this new business. We built a new cloud-based field service automation solution based on a third- party platform to provide advanced capabilities in intelligent scheduling, dispatching and mobile workforce management to transform field operations. The new solution has helped significantly improve the predictability of services, enhancing customer experience. It is also highly scalable. The utility now plans to expand to more states in the next six months, and achieve half a billion dollars in revenue over the next 24-months. In earlier calls, I have given many examples of enterprises partnering with us to achieve their sustainability goals. There are a couple of stories where sustainability is directly linked to revenue growth. • TCS is the strategic partner for a global alliance, that is focused on decarbonizing the food value chain by helping to transform farming practices globally, promote regenerative farming and generate reliable farm carbon credits and certified climate smart crops. We have helped them conceptualize the business model and build the enabling digital platform for farmer enablement and adoption. It provides a simple and quick way to onboard farmers and other stakeholders, validate carbon smart : Page 7 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) practices through analytics, enables a carbon credit declaration by farmers and provides personalized recommendations of the practices',

The platform drives revenue for the alliance through carbon credit trading, improves farmer incomes and reduces scope pre-emissions and helps the private sector decarbonize. • Similarly, in Massachusetts, we partnered with a leading utility to build a platform that would help them roll out the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target or SMART incentive system to accelerate solar power adoption in the state. Consumers who install solar panels and storage on the property and to the utilities grid, qualify to receive a monthly incentive payment directly from the state government. The TCS-built solution includes onboarding of new generators, a customer application that helps keep track of the units generated, a pricing engine and a billing system. Using this, the utility was able to achieve regulatory targets on renewable capacity onboarding on the grid. It was able to enroll more than 10,000 residential customers in the last 12 months and is now expanding the program to other states. M&A remains the preferred growth strategy for many enterprises and over the last few years, we have built up a significant business catering to our clients need to integrate new entities that they have acquired or diverse businesses that are no longer strategic. This quarter too, we have few wins in that space. • A global leader in health, nutrition and biosciences is building its nutrition portfolio through acquisitions',
    'M&A remains the preferred growth strategy for many enterprises and over the last few years, we have built up a significant business catering to our clients need to integrate new entities that they have acquired or diverse businesses that are no longer strategic. This quarter too, we have few wins in that space. • A global leader in health, nutrition and biosciences is building its nutrition portfolio through acquisitions. In 2020, after executing its largest and most complex acquisition in two decades, it engaged TCS to help integrate the new entity. Our team helped envision changes to the enterprise model to allow for a seamless integration. The first phase of integration was completed in Q1 and helped bring onboard the new entity, provide common ways of working and deliver synergies. We commonly think of G&T as front-end customer-facing work. But we have plenty of examples of operations transformation that reimagine processes at the backend using digital technologies like AI, resulting in much faster turnaround times, much higher throughput, and therefore, more revenue. Let me give you a couple of examples of these: : Page 8 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) • For a leading global HR services firm, TCS partnered to transform their core recruitment process leveraging next-generation technologies. Their existing processes entailed recruiters spending 60% to 70% of their effort on profile sourcing and screening, of which 50% was devoted to candidate outreach. Over half the outreach efforts was wasted due to lack of response or declines. TCS redesigned the end-to-end recruitment process, taking a Machine First™ approach. We built bots to automate the background check initiations across clients and deployed a third-party AI-powered candidate outreach platform to significantly bring down recruiter effort and completely streamline the candidate screening process',
    'Over half the outreach efforts was wasted due to lack of response or declines. TCS redesigned the end-to-end recruitment process, taking a Machine First™ approach. We built bots to automate the background check initiations across clients and deployed a third-party AI-powered candidate outreach platform to significantly bring down recruiter effort and completely streamline the candidate screening process. This resulted in a 300% increase in number of shortlist candidates, a 15-20% reduction in turnaround time, and most importantly, a 42% increase in hiring throughput, which is directly linked to revenue growth for the company. • Similarly, a large US insurer has engaged TCS to transform its personal lines of business. The vision is to simplify business processes, modernize the technology stack, enable faster launch of new products and product enhancements for greater competitiveness, enhanced customer experience and profitable growth. TCS helped reimagine and implement significant improvements in pricing, risk assessment, acquisition and servicing of customers using a third-party platform. On completion, the new solution will enable ensure issuance of a new policy in eight minutes versus the current 24-hours. It will significantly improve the quality, granularity and timeliness of data and analytics to support better targeting and personalization. The solutions or features are expected to help improve business agility, enhance customer experience and drive growth. Coming to the Q1 order book, as you know, we had an all-time high order book TCV last quarter. On the back of that, we again had a strong set of deal wins in Q1 amounting to a TCV of $8.2 billion. The deal mix is very heterogeneous, with the largest two deals being just over $400 million in size. By vertical, BFSI had a TCV of $2.6 billion, while retail order book stood at $1.2 billion. The TCV of deals signed in North America stood at $4.5 billion',

The TCV of deals signed in North America stood at $4.5 billion. Looking at the strong order book and our pipeline, this is good visibility for the next few months. We have not seen any budget cuts or deferments so far. In conversations with clients, we see continuing investments in technology. Some clients, particularly in Europe have expressed concerns about the macroeconomic fallout of the ongoing : Page 9 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) conflict there. But the predominant sense is that technology spending will be resilient. That said, given the macro level uncertainties, we remain very watchful. With that, we'll open the line for questions. Over to you, Kedar. Moderator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from the line of Ankur Rudra from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Ankur Rudra: A few questions from me today. First, Rajesh, could you maybe elaborate on the tone of conversations you had with clients on perhaps new growth and transformation contracts. How has that evolved this quarter? And in addition to that, how do you think the pipeline formation has been? And finally, how should we interpret the fact that deal signing to the growth on a year-over-year basis seems to be sort of flattening out and the book-to-bill ratio seem to be lower than the last couple of years? Rajesh Gopinathan: Hi Ankur. As you can imagine, we have been staying very close to our customers given the overall news flow that we see all around us",
    "How has that evolved this quarter? And in addition to that, how do you think the pipeline formation has been? And finally, how should we interpret the fact that deal signing to the growth on a year-over-year basis seems to be sort of flattening out and the book-to-bill ratio seem to be lower than the last couple of years? Rajesh Gopinathan: Hi Ankur. As you can imagine, we have been staying very close to our customers given the overall news flow that we see all around us. We have been at all levels personally reaching out, meeting with as many customers as we can. The general sense that we're getting is that at the operating level, the demand continues to be very strong and unabated. There is high visibility of project funding; there is appetite for continuing investments and in fact, for acceleration. So, the demand environment on an immediate basis continues to be very strong. Some conversations at senior executive levels – CEO, COO, level, etc., are more about what they see overall about the whole macro environment that you spoke about. But that elevated conversation does not seem to be reflecting in the actual budgets and the spend. We have not seen any project cancellations, pull backs, nothing of that sort. And this is across both transformation projects as well as on the optimization projects. Overall, we are, as you can imagine, staying very vigilant, maximizing contact with customers and taking it on a case-to-case basis, and reacting to what we have on hand and maintaining that stance. Ankur Rudra: Second part, Rajesh, should investors read anything into the fact that the book-to-bill ratios have dropped a bit this year versus the last years at this time? Rajesh Gopinathan: TCV is a forward-looking number. It is what it is. I gave you the commentary on what we're seeing on the field. The actual closures, that number is there. When we look at our pipeline and overall trend, I don't think there's anything that is alarming for us. A 1",

When we look at our pipeline and overall trend, I don't think there's anything that is alarming for us. A 1.2 times book-to-bill is still quite strong. So, nothing more than that from our perspective, but we're also being very vigilant. : Page 10 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) Ankur Rudra: Of course, nobody knows the future, but I know you've always said it like you see it, if we do hit the R word recession, what are the key points you would look for and how do you feel about TCS position in the market now versus the previous down cycles over the last two decades? Rajesh Gopinathan: Ankur, we have been continuously investing in improving our strength on both sides of the market opportunity. That is what we call the twin-engine strategy of cost and optimization, and growth and transformation. The transformation part of the agenda is equally applicable on either side of that economic scenario. So, from a positioning perspective, we are quite happy with where we are both in terms of capabilities as well as our positioning in the market and our client engagement. That's an area that we have been continuously investing in. From an operating perspective, we have built up the capacity, we are well positioned to be able to move rapidly in either direction, if things change in any way. So, I'm quite confident that our agility is going to be able to be our biggest strength, and also our reputation and our client relationships will come through significantly if there is some uncertainty or any volatility. Ankur Rudra: Last question on margins if I can",

Ankur Rudra: Last question on margins if I can. Were there more headwinds in 1Q than previously thought, Samir, and do you think the range of outcomes now for the year looks maybe softer than what you thought a quarter ago? Rajesh Gopinathan: Could you repeat that, Ankur? You're saying as far as margin goes… Ankur Rudra: As far as margin goes, do you think you saw more headwinds in June quarter versus what you thought in the beginning of the quarter in terms of the percentage and how do you think about the rest of the year now? Rajesh Gopinathan: Nothing different from what we saw in the beginning of the quarter. There are two things that are playing out there. One is the wage increase, which is a fairly well understood one. The other is the continuing demand environment and the attrition environment that is leading to the increased operating costs on the employee side. The attrition is not totally unanticipated, but it is continuing and we think that probably it will take another few more months before it will start to come down. So, till then the margin pressures will continue but we hope to sequentially improve from where we are, given that we have taken a hit on that completely. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Sandip Agarwal from Edelweiss. Please go ahead",

Please go ahead. : Page 11 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) Sandip Agarwal: Rajesh, I have only one question that, when you're talking to the senior executives in your client side, do you see that there is increased recognition in last few quarters that technology is much more core to their business for their growth and profitability than it being something which could be contracted or expanded based on the overall environment or based on the company's performance? The thing I'm trying to understand here is if you see some of the US retailers, they have sounded caution in terms of revenue growth and PAT growth. But at the same time, I think that they have to spend in technology to be relevant in the omnichannel mode. And also secondly, I think, outsourcing is always the most efficient or cost-efficient way of managing things in tough times. So, what is your sense on that, is it really like two decades back or one decade back when you could contract or expand based on your profit and loss account or it is more core to business and to achieve the top line number you need to spend, so, it is not at all discretionary in nature, what is your sense when you speak to your top clients? Rajesh Gopinathan: Sandip, industry-after-industry, the primacy of the technology spend continues to increase and that's reflected in our conversations with clients at senior levels also. So, there is much greater understanding, much greater appreciation of what their technology agenda is",
    "So, there is much greater understanding, much greater appreciation of what their technology agenda is. More importantly, even the most senior person is fully clued in on what the technology strategy or the technology-enabled strategy for the company is respectively. So, that awareness and that centrality of that strategy to their overall plans is very high. Having said that, definitely, if there is an economy wide slowdown, it is likely to have some ripple effect across all lines of spend, but resiliency of technology in the overall mix is unlikely to get diluted from where it has been in the last two years. Sandip Agarwal: On this subcon expense, we are still seeing a significant jump on a quarter-on-quarter basis and what I understand is that it may be partly due to attrition numbers going up. So, is it purely because of attrition going up or it is also related to some restrictions, which were there still in travel side and not been able to spend resources on time or what it is or it is sudden demand, sudden startup project, what is causing that continuous shift in subcon? Rajesh Gopinathan: Sandip, it's a combination of all of it. Definitely, attrition has a role and supply constraints in some of the local markets have a role. Also the fact that it is a variable cost and therefore it has strategic value to us in an uncertain environment. So, all aspects of it play out. We are keeping a close watch on it and we will be reacting to it depending on how the demand/supply situation plays out. : Page 12 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) Moderator: The next question is from the line of Kumar Rakesh from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Kumar Rakesh: My first question was again on the margin side. So, on the subcon side, hypothetically speaking, suppose we enter into a weak demand scenario, and that is one of the levers which we potentially have to improve our cost structure",

Please go ahead. Kumar Rakesh: My first question was again on the margin side. So, on the subcon side, hypothetically speaking, suppose we enter into a weak demand scenario, and that is one of the levers which we potentially have to improve our cost structure. In such a scenario, how much of this subcon benefit we can potentially drive? What I'm trying to understand is how much of our cost impact is coming from subcon currently given the supply constraint which we are facing? Samir Seksaria: So, our subcontractor expenses currently are at 9.7% of our revenues, and have moved up from about 7% levels to where we are currently. And as Rajesh pointed out, we have proactively and strategically invested in creating a bench. Our current priorities are to stay focused on capturing the demand. And we have known how to balance on the subcontractor side. And as the need arises, we'll be able to realign it or balance it. Kumar Rakesh: So, what I understand is that we can stabilize it at 7% if the need arises, right? Samir Seksaria: Yes. Kumar Rakesh: My second question was around the fresher hiring target we had set about 40,000. How we are progressing on that and has that changed that target? Rajesh Gopinathan: No, we are on track for that and we're progressing well on it. This quarter reflecting what we already had in the system, we've been a bit lighter on the one which typically has been our long term trend, Q1 is a lighter quarter for trainee absorption whereas Q2 and Q3 are the primary quarters. Last year, we had gone very aggressive and hired through the year to build up more than 100,000 trainee bench. This year is more than normal. We're progressing well on that 40,000 mark. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Gaurav Rateria from Morgan Stanley",

Moderator: The next question is from the line of Gaurav Rateria from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Gaurav Rateria: So, first question is with respect to the UK market. If you look at the YoY growth, it has been actually slowing down and it's a clear divergence compared to the North America market, which is continuing to remain very, very strong. So, what's really going on there, are the trends or the discussions actually fructifying in the form of a little bit of a slowdown in the velocity of the deal closures, or the ramp ups, any trend that you can highlight will be helpful. N G Subramaniam: NGS here. Both in the UK and North American market, we don't see any anomalies or abnormalities in terms of customer behavior or the deal closure trends. All of this : Page 13 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) remains normal and in line with typically what we experience. Specifically in the UK, there have been some concerns about the increased cost of living that people experience, etc., But then, it's all in the macro level discussions that we have. But overall, as Rajesh pointed out, customers across our verticals, Manufacturing or Retail or Financial services, have not expressed anything, which is something that that will cause a concern for us at this moment. Gaurav Rateria: Second question is on the margin. So, getting back to 25% looks like an immediate priority, but should one thing that from a full year perspective, the margins could remain a tad lower than 25% as it will take some bit of progression to come to 25% over the coming quarters? Samir Seksaria: That has always been the case. Our Q1 margins are subdued when we gave out the full cycle of increment",
    "Gaurav Rateria: Second question is on the margin.

Samir Seksaria: That has always been the case. Our Q1 margins are subdued when we gave out the full cycle of increment. And we do look forward to clawing it back during the period. And our target would be to reach and cross 25% as far as possible. Gaurav Rateria: Lastly, any change in your expectations with respect to price improvements that you were expecting, realization improvement that you were expecting as part of your client conversations a couple of months back that you had highlighted? Rajesh Gopinathan: No, it continues to be positive. Rather than large scale contract level changes, we're seeing more pointed ones on existing contracts and the newer contracts getting some uplift. So, we're seeing smaller increases in existing ones and newer contracts coming in at better terms. Also with existing renewals, certain terms like COLA are much better being able to push through. But the aggregate impact of it is still not positive. So, our overall realization numbers reflect the excess capacity that we have, and are still negative on a sequential basis. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Ravi Menon from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Ravi Menon: Rajesh, are there any soft spots that you see in any vertical you're seeing in the pipeline shift towards more efficiency or programs? Rajesh Gopinathan: No, Ravi, we're not seeing much from a vertical perspective. It seems to be fairly balanced across. Nothing at this stage that you can call out at a vertical level. Ravi Menon: We had heard your comments in the press conference, you were talking about how the US will likely be the main driver of growth during the near term",

Ravi Menon: We had heard your comments in the press conference, you were talking about how the US will likely be the main driver of growth during the near term. But I thought in Europe, our market share is still fairly small. So, we should have a lot of these gen-two outsourcing contracts come out. So, shouldn't that also be a driver at least medium term once uncertainty settles a bit? : Page 14 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) Rajesh Gopinathan: The context of the comment is more in terms of what we're hearing from customers. You're right that traditionally, when Europe has done badly, we've still done much better, reflecting that lower market share and our continuous consolidation in that market. What I was mentioning was that when we look at the kind of commentary that we're hearing from customers, in US, the expectation is that they don't know if there is going to be a recession, when is it going to be, and even if it comes it will be a shallow one. Whereas the expectation in Europe is that it is more of a question of time, and it might be much deeper than what the US customers feel. So, that difference in perception is what we were commenting about, that US is the one where the confidence levels are high, and the demand environment is likely to stay very robust. How it plays out for us, that will depend on how well we are able to capitalize on both sides of that equation. Ravi Menon: One follow up, I think we've talked about the bench quite a bit. We've seen strong hiring well ahead of revenue growth for quite some time now",

We've seen strong hiring well ahead of revenue growth for quite some time now. But we've also seen sub contracting keep going up. While you've been building up capacity and bench, so why is this not really showing up in lower subcontracting, when should we start seeing revenue growth and headcount growth start converging? Rajesh Gopinathan: See, subcontractors are also based on supply disruptions at a local market level. So, that definitely has a role to play. As travel opens up, as more normal talent movement opens up, our opportunity to optimize that will also improve. The aggregate bench versus the one will also play up depending on what our long term view or medium term view on demand is. So, there are both drivers at play. One is immediate capture of demand and the other is the supply disruption in local markets. Ravi Menon: When you said that you should see this normalize, should this also be linked to attrition, when we see attrition start coming off, should we think about you know, the utilization moving up? Rajesh Gopinathan: You're saying that as attrition comes down, will utilization move up? Yes, that's a reasonable assumption. That's our typical operating model also. When in a high demand scenario, we first address demand and attrition is also linked into that. So, we'll see. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah from Equirus Securities.

Just on Europe, you have discussed about UK. Can you also discuss about continental Europe because in the last four to five quarters, the growth in continental Europe on a sequential basis is a bit lower and softish versus company average. So, one can believe with the macro concerns or this is more specific to TCS as a whole? Rajesh Gopinathan: That we'll have to look across, but we are not seeing any significant change to the demand environment in Europe across the board. 12% is still a decent growth number. As I said, the commentary that we're hearing from clients is a bit more mixed in Europe compared to North America, but at an immediate demand basis, we're not seeing anything that is significant. Sandeep Shah: And just a second question that with increasing macro concerns, some of your global peers are saying clients have also started discussion on outsourcing led deals, which you also highlighted, Rajesh, in your comments where the multi-tower outsourcing deals are increasing in first quarter versus the last four quarters. So, is it fair to say that outsourcing led deals can increase and large caps including you could be a fair beneficiary of this going forward? Rajesh Gopinathan: Our twin engine strategy is essentially predicated on that we have relevance in both scenarios, both consolidation scenario as well as growth scenario",
    "So, is it fair to say that outsourcing led deals can increase and large caps including you could be a fair beneficiary of this going forward? Rajesh Gopinathan: Our twin engine strategy is essentially predicated on that we have relevance in both scenarios, both consolidation scenario as well as growth scenario. So, we do believe that our continuous investment in a broad-based set of services and holistic structure positions us very well to be a single source strategic provider to the client, who can actually use that opportunity to drive the transformation and set themselves up for the growth phase also. And that value is what is driving some of those deals that we have described in this quarter. Sandeep Shah: Last year because of attrition and supply side issue, our margin pull off from the first quarter seasonal decline was lower in the second to fourth quarter. One can say we are largely behind and from 2Q to 4Q of FY'23 our normal seasonality may start where margin pull off on the upward side could be higher versus what we have seen in FY'22. Samir Seksaria: Yes, that is reasonable to expect. We should see an upward trajectory, that's our target. Last year, we saw the full impact of supply side playing out and that's what played out on the margins as well. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Debashish Mazumdar from B&K Securities. Please go ahead. D Mazumdar: Just one small question. I need to understand as far as the margin trajectory is concerned, in a normal year, we see the entry margins are lower and exit margins are normally higher, which was not the case last year; last year, we started with 25.5%, we : Page 16 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) ended with 25%. So, this year, we are starting with 23.1%. So, how confident we are that this 23",

So, this year, we are starting with 23.1%. So, how confident we are that this 23.1% trajectory when you move out from hereon and it is kind of bottomed- out? Samir Seksaria: I just responded the same thing to the previous question as well. Our target is we expect that it would be on an increasing trajectory. And that has been the usual trend except for last year. Our target is that it should improve and we should get closer to what we exited in Q4. D Mazumdar: If we see the competition statements around attrition, the quarterly annualized attrition for other competition has started coming down from Q4 onwards, whereas for us the commentary that is stabling currently. So, just wanted to get some sense and from the salary hikes it seems to be the salary hikes are almost similar to the salary hike that we have given last year, whereas some of our competitions were extremely aggressive in giving salary hikes. So, just wanted to get some sense that in terms of controlling attrition… I'm not asking about the overall number, because it is much lower than peers, but in terms of trajectory of controlling attrition, like we are a little behind the curve as compared to others. Rajesh Gopinathan: Our employee rewards program is much more holistic than period-to-period one. I believe that our employee retention numbers also reflect this holistic employee engagement and total rewards program. So, we are quite confident about where we are. You will recall that even at the height of the pandemic, we were the ones who first said that we will not be laying off anybody",
    "Rajesh Gopinathan: Our employee rewards program is much more holistic than period-to-period one.

You will recall that even at the height of the pandemic, we were the ones who first said that we will not be laying off anybody. We honored all offers, we were the first to announce the salary hikes in October of 2020. So, our program is not entirely based on what the short-term impacts are and we're quite confident and comfortable with what we're executing. We believe that these numbers will reflect that. So, as I said, our expectation is that attrition will start tapering off in the next few months being three months, four months, whatever is the time. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Dipesh Mehta from Emkay Global. Please go ahead. Dipesh Mehta: A couple of questions. Starting with regional market, if I look at our regional market performance remain muted for some time and even though BFSI also remains softer, so if you can provide some sense about how we should look at regional market? Second question is about the fresher hiring. We are indicating about 40,000 for FY 23. But considering that we plan one year advance, how many offers are we planning for : Page 17 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) FY 24? And last question is about deal pipeline. Any softness or any uptick we're seeing in deal pipeline build up, if you can comment on that? N G Subramaniam: Regional markets, by definition, is volatile. We group some of our emerging businesses and emerging market businesses into that bucket",
    "Any softness or any uptick we're seeing in deal pipeline build up, if you can comment on that? N G Subramaniam: Regional markets, by definition, is volatile. We group some of our emerging businesses and emerging market businesses into that bucket. But overall, if you look at it, how the Asia Pacific market or functions of the Middle East, Africa market functions, these markets do not provide big opportunities for an annuity-based revenue, there are typically project-based revenues. So, there is always a volatility that is there. The second question was with respect to the fresher hiring of 40,000. As Rajesh mentioned, we are – Dipesh Mehta: No, question was for '24. N G Subramaniam: I think, on average, we always started with 40,000 given our size and shape of our business. But then you really look at the last year as well when we said the 40,000, but then when we went on to hire up to 100,000, our hiring engine was able to do that. So, we have that ability and agility to hire talent and fortunately, we are able to attract the right talent given our brand, given the opportunities that we offer to our employees. Dipesh Mehta: Last question was about deal pipeline built up. Any changes we are seeing there? N G Subramaniam: We are not seeing any major deviation or abnormalities in that. With a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2, it is looking good and the combination of the pipeline that we are pursuing today across the markets is quite similar to what we have experienced now in the previous years and the type of opportunities are also in line with the demand that we see for the type of technologies and a good combination of both cost optimization as well as growth and transformation. It also has several large, medium as well as smaller deals. Good broad-based pipeline that we have, and we are happy with what we have been able to put in the pipeline and then pursuing those opportunities. Dipesh Mehta: Last question is about onsite salary",

Good broad-based pipeline that we have, and we are happy with what we have been able to put in the pipeline and then pursuing those opportunities. Dipesh Mehta: Last question is about onsite salary. Can you quantify what kind of hike we give for onsite employees this quarter? N G Subramaniam: Average is between 4% and 5% for the onsite salary hikes we have given. But give allowance to the fact that for top performers, the potential earnout has been higher based on their performance. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Manik Taneja from JM Financial. Please go ahead. Manik Taneja: I had a couple of questions. Number one is that you mentioned that some of your senior client executive conversations are suggesting some concerns on the macro economic : Page 18 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) environment. Is that also translating in terms of any potential impact on pricing discussions? Rajesh Gopinathan: As I said earlier, the discussions on macro are not getting reflected in any of the actual project contract or deal pipeline currently. And I just gave you that color in terms of the nature of the competition and how that is different market-to-market. We are not seeing any reflection of that at the actual operating and deal levels. Manik Taneja: I wanted to understand if you would be looking to revisit the onboarding timelines for the 40,000-odd freshers offers that we made for FY'23 if the situation deteriorates. Rajesh Gopinathan: We do not do that. We honor all offers that we make. We do not defer joining or do any form of such management. That's not part of our philosophy. Any offer that we make, we honor it based on whatever is the timeline committed on it. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Apurva Prasad from HDFC Securities. Please go ahead.

Apurva Prasad: Rajesh, just a couple of quick ones. Most of the others have been covered. So, first one is on pricing. Are you seeing any incremental challenges in getting price increase even though that being selective say versus the previous quarter? And the second question is on Retail and CPG. Are there some early signs of some softness there, and I'm referencing to the book-to-bill has been significantly higher than the past three years, this looks excellent down a lot more. Rajesh Gopinathan: No, on pricing, actually, the conversations are picking up momentum rather than losing momentum. So, absolutely no reflection there. On retail, those TCV numbers are normal nature of TCV rather than anything else. We are seeing very strong transformation agendas across many retailers, especially grocery and essential retailers, where significant transformation programs are getting executed and we see continuing demand. So, overall the pipeline is quite strong and the demand environment also in retail is very strong. Moderator: Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. I now hand the conference over to the management for the closing comments. Rajesh Gopinathan: Thank you. It has been a good start to the year with 15.5% growth in constant currency, and with all our industry verticals showing good growth. Our order book and pipeline is also very strong, giving us good visibility for the next few months. Our margin dipped this quarter due to salary increase and supply side related costs. But we stay confident in our ability to bring it back to a preferred range over time",

Our order book and pipeline is also very strong, giving us good visibility for the next few months. Our margin dipped this quarter due to salary increase and supply side related costs. But we stay confident in our ability to bring it back to a preferred range over time. : Page 19 of 20 Tata Consultancy Services Q1 & FY23 Earnings Conference Call July 08, 2022, 19:00 pm IST (09:30 hrs US ET) On the people front, we continue to hire across all our markets and added over 14,000 employees on a net basis in Q1. Our attrition continues to be elevated at 19.7% in IT services on an LTM basis. This will probably peak next quarter and will start tapering out. With that we wrap up our call. Thank you all for joining us on this call today. Enjoy the rest of your evening or day and stay safe. Moderator: Thank you members of the management. On behalf of TCS that concludes this conference.

    '1,000 crores for EyeCare, Rs. 500 crores for International business, Rs. 200 crores for the Perfumes business; all in all, a very very satisfying quarter. All the mature businesses continue to grow at a very satisfactory and ambitious rate. All the emerging businesses growing at a scorching pace including the women’s bags and the Taneira business establishing themselves strongly; internationally becoming very prominent in the NRI/PIO space in the GCC and in the United States. All in all, a fantastic quarter and I would like to thank all the employees of Titan Company, TEAL, CaratLane, and all other subsidiaries as well as all our partners in the manufacturing side, their employees, all the partners in the retail and distribution side and their employees, and all other partners who work in some way or the other in support of Titan Company and its subsidiaries for continuing to deliver exceptional standards in customer experience, innovation, operational excellence, and through all that to deliver great sales and profit growth. And of course, my thanks to all of you on the call, as always challenging us, wishing us well, encouraging us, and asking the sharp questions that you ask all the time. My part in this part of the call is concluding and we can move into the Q&A. Moderator: We will now begin the question & answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, we will wait for a moment while the question queue assembles. The first question is from the line of Avi Mehta from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Avi Mehta: Sir, my first question was on the jewellery side. Has the moderation seen in customer demand in March because of the sharp gold price rise? Has that weaned off in April? And could you give us some sense on how the growth trends are behaving? Ajoy Chawla: You are right. March saw a softening and it continued into the first half of April',
    'The first question is from the line of Avi Mehta from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Avi Mehta: Sir, my first question was on the jewellery side. Has the moderation seen in customer demand in March because of the sharp gold price rise? Has that weaned off in April? And could you give us some sense on how the growth trends are behaving? Ajoy Chawla: You are right. March saw a softening and it continued into the first half of April. I think gold price volatility has usually kept many people on the fence, but as soon as the festive period started and the offer started for Akshaya Tritiya, we saw a lot of people coming to the market and thereafter, it was very good. I think the volatility piece in demand linked to gold price volatility continues. In the festive season and wedding season, and let’s say there are opportunities and occasions to buy, it’s very good. And then, if there is some nervousness, it Page 2 of 18 tends to fall. But overall, I would say it was a very good Akshaya Tritiya for us and it’s in line with what we think, what our plans are for the year. Titan Company Limited May 3, 2023 Avi Mehta: And would you be able to share some plans for the year or what your thoughts are? Any numbers over there? Ajoy Chawla: No, I don’t think we can share numbers, but you guys are well aware of our longer-term plan, and in some ways, our annual plans are pegged to the long-term plan that we had set out during the investor day. And in that context, therefore, we are on line with that. Avi Mehta: The other bit, sir, there is this change in the franchisee rates which was carried out during the quarter. If you could give us some sense on what exactly it was and give us an idea of what is the impact that we should expect on margins and growth? Ajoy Chawla: This is a very operational matter. Terms of trade between the principal and the franchisees are typically to ensure healthy returns and good profitability for the franchisee',
    'Avi Mehta: The other bit, sir, there is this change in the franchisee rates which was carried out during the quarter. If you could give us some sense on what exactly it was and give us an idea of what is the impact that we should expect on margins and growth? Ajoy Chawla: This is a very operational matter. Terms of trade between the principal and the franchisees are typically to ensure healthy returns and good profitability for the franchisee. Just so that all of us are clear, when it comes to the jewellery and Tanishq franchisees, we are best in class returns and in fact people make exceptionally good profits and returns on investment, so much so that most of the franchisees want the second, third, fourth, fifth store and we are unable to fulfill their desire because we have…. Even they are happy to take the next store 100 km away or 200 km away in another city, even international. We have actually had a huge request from all our franchisee community to give higher things. Just to share with you, best-in-class returns across all forms of retail that might be there and I won’t be surprised if it’s across the world. This old structure was about 15 years old and the nature, scale, product mix of the business has significantly changed in the last 15 years; the slabs have changed, everything has changed. So, we needed to align and, in a way, update it and the other important piece is the product mix which is profitable, which works well for the company, as well as works well for the franchisees needs to be aligned in the same way so that all of us are firing in the same direction. And that is something which we wanted to structurally change. We also wanted to introduce new categories of complexities of products, because we are seeing that opportunity to in a way gain in different complexities of gold. So, many structural changes, all driven towards aligning growth and profitable growth for both the associate and us',
    'And that is something which we wanted to structurally change. We also wanted to introduce new categories of complexities of products, because we are seeing that opportunity to in a way gain in different complexities of gold. So, many structural changes, all driven towards aligning growth and profitable growth for both the associate and us. Also, during the last couple of years, the division has invested significantly in both inventory as well as gold rates to deliver terrific growth and this investment has come significantly from the organization as well. So, in a way, this was kind of a restructuring. Absolutely very limited impact in terms of profitability to us. In fact, many franchisees have gained, and some may have lost. But actually, we don’t know because the mix they will sell in the current year or in the next year will determine the exact gains or losses. And in our estimate, many of them will actually gain. And there is no significant impact on the company in terms of sheer margins or whatever. Nothing much. It’s an operational piece actually. Page 3 of 18 Titan Company Limited May 3, 2023 Avi Mehta: If I may summarize or paraphrase the way it is, that this is to modify the incentives to move product mix upwards and should not result in any impact to the franchisee profitability. Would that be a fair statement to make, sir? Ajoy Chawla: It is difficult to conclude because we have some 200 odd franchisees in the system. Some may lose depending on what mix they sell, and many others may gain. So, it’s very difficult to conclude it in one line. And in any case, we have been a very fair partner. Even if somebody actually loses, we will invest a lot more in ensuring growth. So, that’s not something we worry about. Avi Mehta: And sir, if with your permission, just one last bit on the watch side. We saw very strong growth, but margins were below the range that we were looking at of 13-14%',

Avi Mehta: And sir, if with your permission, just one last bit on the watch side. We saw very strong growth, but margins were below the range that we were looking at of 13-14%. Would you revisit this target, or could you share with us how you see this internally? Suparna Mitra: The strong revenue growth was also because of a lot of investments, etc., and there were some actuarial calculations which came and hit our overall profits. But we are quite satisfied with the margin, and it is in line with what I have indicated in previous investor calls also, that margin for the watches business this year for example is likely to be in the 12-13%. It is in that range. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Nitin Jain from Fairview Investment. Please go ahead. Nitin Jain: My first question is on the jewellery business. Some of your national competitors like Kalyan and Malabar, have moved to one nation, one gold price policy. Does that lead to any change in the gold rate premium that Tanishq has been charging historically? And what would be the impact on EBIT margins going forward? And my next question is on the dividend payout. While the quantum has increased this year, the payout ratio has actually declined. Comments on that please. Ajoy Chawla: On the one nation, one gold rate, actually this is now a 16-month-old story. Malabar had started it around Diwali the year before last in FY22 and thereafter many local players, maybe not one but lowest gold rate offering. That is actually for the customer it will be in the lowest gold rate offering if that is more relevant. The one India, one gold rate is more of a broader statement',
    'Comments on that please. Ajoy Chawla: On the one nation, one gold rate, actually this is now a 16-month-old story. Malabar had started it around Diwali the year before last in FY22 and thereafter many local players, maybe not one but lowest gold rate offering. That is actually for the customer it will be in the lowest gold rate offering if that is more relevant. The one India, one gold rate is more of a broader statement. Kalyan also responded in many markets in that way and has eventually figured out that he wants to stick to one because the Kerala Jewelers Association had some kind of conversation and for some reason, their gold rates were much lower than the rest of the market. We have chosen not to go down that path. We have instead looked at what is a relevant competitor in different markets. Historically, we have seen there is a wide dispersion of gold rates across the country. Local jewellery associations actually declare the gold rate, and everybody plays according to that. And therefore, we have chosen to optimize along those routes. Some of those are getting rationalized over a period of time and we are in a way ensuring that we remain competitive market by market. So, consequently, I have mentioned in previous investor calls we have therefore seen a gradual reduction in the gold rate markup side of the gold jewellery margin, but Page 4 of 18 Titan Company Limited May 3, 2023 we have been managing it through product mix, through making charges, and through other initiatives to try and ensure that we still continue to live up to good GCs and therefore good EBIT margins. That process is on. So, I won’t be able to comment much on GCs further. We have already taken fair amounts of corrections in the past and yet been able to deliver the EBIT margin that we have been committing to and we still stay by that. Irrespective of the competitive intensity, we are expecting to sustain our EBIT margins',
    'That process is on. So, I won’t be able to comment much on GCs further. We have already taken fair amounts of corrections in the past and yet been able to deliver the EBIT margin that we have been committing to and we still stay by that. Irrespective of the competitive intensity, we are expecting to sustain our EBIT margins. We are not too worried about any further dilution even if there is here and there mix related and product engineering related as many other operating leverage related initiatives are in place to ensure that we continue to deliver healthy margins in this business. Ashok Sonthalia: Our dividend policy suggests that we will maintain a dividend payout between a band of 25% to 40% and this year dividend declaration while it is substantially increased over the last 2 years, is about 26.6% of the profit margin and Board consider every aspect of our requirement and growth, and what kind of investment plans we have, and what is the cash balance on the balance sheet, etc., and then accordingly decide a number which is within the band. It’s a decision keeping all these considerations in mind. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Percy Panthaki from IIFL. Please go ahead. Percy Panthaki: My question is for Ajoy. Ajoy, congrats. This quarter, you have done a 19% same-store sales growth in the jewellery division. My question is that a large part of this 19% is coming because there is a big inflation in the gold price. If let’s say the gold price going ahead were to stabilize and at some point, of time the Y-o-Y gold price inflation if it comes close to zero, in that kind of a scenario, what would be a sort of normal or a stereotypical target SSSG that you would tend to have in a flat gold price scenario? That’s my first question. Ajoy Chawla: We have had these conversations a couple of times – once in person and a couple of times on the call',
    'If let’s say the gold price going ahead were to stabilize and at some point, of time the Y-o-Y gold price inflation if it comes close to zero, in that kind of a scenario, what would be a sort of normal or a stereotypical target SSSG that you would tend to have in a flat gold price scenario? That’s my first question. Ajoy Chawla: We have had these conversations a couple of times – once in person and a couple of times on the call. We would still like to suggest that for us, volume is not linked to grammage and therefore, gold price inflation is equal to…. The way we look at it is the number of customers and the average ticket size. Just because there is a 19% like-to-like growth and even if there was technically a very high gold price related inflation, it doesn’t translate it exactly that way. Just to give you a sense, if I look at 19% same-store growth in value, we have had overall buyer growth of around close to 16%. On same store, that number would be closer to maybe 10-11%. Typically, if gold price was not to inflate, there is nothing to say that we can’t continue to gain number of customers because we continue to gain a significant number of new customers. Even in quarter 4, our new-to-repeat is 50-50. We have grown pretty equally in both segments. Gold price inflation may be helping in ticket size but it’s not necessarily so. People also enrich in terms of product mix. As long as we are continuing to get more customers and there is customer growth for every store, especially same-store growth and then there is a ticket size increase which may happen due to product mix enrichment; not just only because of grammage but the kind of products they buy, studded ratios, and more complex products, etc. We are not worried about this. Therefore, same-store growth, it is our endeavor we should continue to deliver double-digit Page 5 of 18 Titan Company Limited May 3, 2023 same-store growth',
    'We are not worried about this. Therefore, same-store growth, it is our endeavor we should continue to deliver double-digit Page 5 of 18 Titan Company Limited May 3, 2023 same-store growth. That’s how every store and business can really prosper, and we are targeting certainly much more than this double digit or whatever. We are targeting good double-digit growth going forward for same stores. So, it is nothing to do with the gold price for us, just to clarify. Percy Panthaki: My next question is on the retail area addition in jewellery – the square feet. What percentage of addition are you planning annually for FY24 and FY25? Ajoy Chawla: I don’t have a square footage number, but I can just share with you that – if I just look at quarter 4 – we have added 11 new stores, but we have also significantly expanded the existing 10 stores. And when I say significant expansion of these 10 stores, it is either a 25-30% increase in the retail area, or on an absolute level I believe 1,500 to 2,000 square feet. So, effectively, if I look at both these figures together, we seem to have added a lot more square footage than would be evident from the sheer number of stores. We have quite a few stores even in the current year where we are looking at significant retail expansion. I think another 15 to 20 stores will see significant retail expansion. In addition to that, we expect to certainly add 40+ new stores. The opportunity is not the limit. For us, here our ability to execute, find the right places, ensuring they are built to suit, and everything is working well. The opportunity is much larger than that, but typically, we have set out around 40 stores. The opportunity space over the next 2 years, if you ask me could be 100 new stores as well. But a lot depends on how much we are able to execute',
    'In addition to that, we expect to certainly add 40+ new stores. The opportunity is not the limit.

But a lot depends on how much we are able to execute. Historically, we seem to have been able to execute 30 to 40 in a year, but in addition to that, we will do this retail expansion program as well which we have commenced strongly from the last 12 months. I hope that answers. I don’t have a square footage percentage to help you with. Percy Panthaki: Last question on Eyewear. Margins even if I adjust for that Rs. 8 crores one-time, margins are sort of in the mid-single digits. I thought we had this model now very well established where we would be doing a low-to-mid teens kind of EBITDA margin in Eyewear. What really went wrong this quarter? Saumen Bhaumik: If you look at the last 6-7 quarters, you would have realized that what we said mid-teens I think we have held onto this more or less. The exception was last year’s quarter 4 and, in a way, a similar case is this year quarter 4. Just to spend a minute on quarter 4. We had a very good month of January – in fact the second best in our history – but the second half of quarter 4 slowed down and it in a way sort of affected sales. A few other things also happened simultaneously. We needed to clean up a few things. For example, in the last 2-3 years, many of our franchise stores accumulated stock, especially lenses which were kind of supposed to be used but discolored so we had to take them back. Then, in our distribution system also, we need to make sure that there isn’t any unnecessary stockpile up because you are making a change in our product portfolio',
    'A few other things also happened simultaneously. We needed to clean up a few things.

Then, in our distribution system also, we need to make sure that there isn’t any unnecessary stockpile up because you are making a change in our product portfolio. So, we needed to give a month’s gap really to sort of downstock a bit so that a new portfolio of products can go to the trade channel with a restructured margin so that we actually have a greater level of penetration. All that has cost a sale compression to a level of over 70% of what we had Page 6 of 18 Titan Company Limited May 3, 2023 budgeted. That’s one side of the story. And the other side is GC actually held. On the cost front, a few annualized figures came in whether it is employee related actuarial that was mentioned once. We also opened I think 18-19 company stores which were not budgeted earlier. So, as a result, both on the rent front in quarter 2 and mostly in quarter 3 and quarter 4, as a result both in rent as well as employee cost, you would have seen the impact of it. Obviously, we will gain from this edition significantly in the coming year both on the margin side and otherwise. Apart from that, we had to shut down about 22 stores in quarter 4 which was not really working out and a few stores that happened at the end of quarter 3. All put together, there are a few one-time exceptional costs that have come. And this apart, also we decided that it is appropriate to sort of share some of our wealth that we have created with our franchisees who lived with us during the most difficult times of last year. That is the Rs. 8 crores that we have spent',

That is the Rs. 8 crores that we have spent. All put together, there is a one-time impact in the PBT but if I adjust for all these things and if I look at what we did to make FY24 to have a great clean beginning, I think thankfully we are seeing it in the month of April. We had the best month in our history. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Jay Doshi from Kotak. Please go ahead. Jaykumar Doshi: My first question is on margins. Even adjusted for one-offs that you had in the first half of this year; you ended the year with a little over 13% jewellery EBIT margin for standalone business. And whatever I gathered from the earlier response is that the gold rate is not a concern anymore. So, I assume that there is no further margin pressure. Given that backdrop, are you confident of maintaining margins at similar levels in FY24 assuming the growth shapes up on your expected lines? Ajoy Chawla: First of all, I think these margins vary by quarter based on the mix. Jaykumar Doshi: I was referring to FY24 versus FY23. Ajoy Chawla: In the full year FY23, we have got an EBIT margin of 13.7%. There is an impact which is there this year of around 0.6% to 0.7% which is on account of custom duty gain which was not there last year which is there in this year and that won’t be there next year. Also, there is a certain element of stock gains on account of diamond inventory which is also sitting in this. So, this 13.7 has the benefit of almost about a percentage between these two elements, both of which we don’t anticipate to see in the next year',
    '7%.

Also, there is a certain element of stock gains on account of diamond inventory which is also sitting in this. So, this 13.7 has the benefit of almost about a percentage between these two elements, both of which we don’t anticipate to see in the next year. In a way corrected or normalized or adjusted, whichever way you say, it will come between the 12.5% to 13% which we have been talking about. And we expect to sustain this, given competitive intensity, given the growth opportunities in different categories and markets in which we are growing. Jaykumar Doshi: Just a follow-up on your earlier comment. The demand trends over the past few days does it give you confidence that the softness that you had called out in the quarter and business update is now behind us and hopefully this trajectory of healthy growth should continue going forward? Page 7 of 18 Titan Company Limited May 3, 2023 Ajoy Chawla: If I think about it, volatility is here to stay. We have seen it now over the last 3 or 4 quarters. When the going is good, it is really good; and then when there is no reason, people kind of hold back; if gold prices spike, there is some degree of nervousness, etc., but we have kind of learned to play that game and we think we are broadly on course for what we see. It’s difficult to give you an accurate view because as I said the first half of April was dull, but the second half was fantastic. May and June promises to be good because there are a lot of good wedding dates. So, yes, we are hopeful that we should be able to deliver to the plans we have laid out, volatility notwithstanding. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Manoj Menon from ICICI Securities. Please go ahead',

Moderator: The next question is from the line of Manoj Menon from ICICI Securities. Please go ahead. Manoj Menon: Some of the questions which I have, I got some part answers, but allow me to repeat; this is repeat actually. Ajoy, first thing is on the 15 odd percent buyer growth, 10% customer growth at the same-store level, could you help us have some time series understanding of these numbers, let’s say over the last decade? Ajoy Chawla: Time series over the last decade I don’t have…. Manoj Menon: What I mean is this 10% would you call it in the top quartile, bottom quartile, or mid quartile in terms of your own historical customer growth numbers? C. K. Venkataraman: Actually, on the call, Manoj, even I don’t have that for the last decade like that. What we can do is come back to you on that. Ajoy Chawla: And also, Manoj, the other piece is, this is on average figure across so many stores. If you look at it, newer stores will have much better same-store growth until they stabilize. But if you ask me a 10% customer growth for a mature store, I would be very happy. Whether top quartile or not, I don’t know; which decile, which quartile, I don’t know; but generally, will be happy. But you made us think; we will think about the data and come back. Manoj Menon: The reason I asked because based on historical understanding, let’s say your retention power is very very high of the customer, it essentially means that when you have recruited new consumer of this magnitude, would it be fair to say that the customers…. It actually affects my DCF very positively. We will have a conversation separately',
    'But you made us think; we will think about the data and come back. Manoj Menon: The reason I asked because based on historical understanding, let’s say your retention power is very very high of the customer, it essentially means that when you have recruited new consumer of this magnitude, would it be fair to say that the customers…. It actually affects my DCF very positively. We will have a conversation separately. Secondly, on the gold price premium bit, we have also done some primary research on it. Is it fair to say that with all the discussions about let’s say you having a nuanced approach, competition playing a price card, etc., is it fair to say that there is already an equilibrium which exists because at the end of the day, your 20% growth is with this let’s say “headwind”? Ajoy Chawla: Yes, you could say that because the competitive intensity on gold rate and pricing have been pretty intense over the last 15 to 18 months. So, to some extent, you can say there is equilibrium. Whether it will intensify further, don’t know, can’t say. By and large, no. Page 8 of 18 Titan Company Limited May 3, 2023 And just wanted to clarify the previous one. When we talk about customer growth or buyer growth of 10%, it is not all are not new customers. Many of them will be repeat and many will be new. The ratio will vary. C. K. Venkataraman: We are not acquiring 10% on the total base. On the new base, we may be acquiring 10% more. Ajoy Chawla : New to repeat growths are the same. In a sense, we are still getting 50% of our contribution on the overall chain from new customers and 50% from repeat. That percentage will vary based on older stores and newer stores and all that is what Venkat clarified. Manoj Menon: Secondly, on the recycled gold or the gold exchanges have been stable at around 40 odd percent for a while. And I do recall your dialed up or rather you have used this to dial up let’s say to counter the customer acquisition with a low making charge product, etc',
    'In a sense, we are still getting 50% of our contribution on the overall chain from new customers and 50% from repeat.

Manoj Menon: Secondly, on the recycled gold or the gold exchanges have been stable at around 40 odd percent for a while. And I do recall your dialed up or rather you have used this to dial up let’s say to counter the customer acquisition with a low making charge product, etc. The context what I am trying to understand is, do you think directionally, this should go to 50 over the next few years or do you think it can…? Which direction I should take it? Stable? Up? Down? Ajoy Chawla: It has been pretty stable for us. Between 30-33% has been the contribution of gold exchange which is non-Tanishq gold and about 9-10% is the Tanishq exchanged. We are actually seeing a correlation between exchange gold and wedding, and we are trying to use that lever to further increase the excitement around wedding. Therefore, we think it should go up, but whether it is going to go up dramatically, we don’t know. But certainly, we think it will be great. C. K. Venkataraman: The more we are able to increase the share of the gold exchange program, the GEP, actually it will push the growth of the brand because the size of the exchange, the extent of upselling that happens with, when people discover the value of Tanishq exchange itself as well as the products and all that, the upsell potential is also high. There is a good correlation between the increase in the share of exchange and the growth of the brand in total. So, we will continue to push that, but it is a very complex final thing to actually happen, and therefore, the result we know only when we actually see it',
    'There is a good correlation between the increase in the share of exchange and the growth of the brand in total. So, we will continue to push that, but it is a very complex final thing to actually happen, and therefore, the result we know only when we actually see it. Manoj Menon: The only reason I asked because at this rate of 40% because there is a cost aspect also there because you are buying and selling gold at the same price versus selling on cash which will help you get that extra bit of let’s say brand premium. The third and if I may, just one quick one. Ajoy, you mentioned about the…. let’s say focusing again or rather even more doubling down on the wedding part of the business, where do you put the inventory and the store at this point in general? Is it optimal or do you think there is a requirement to let’s say work with a slightly lesser turn or higher inventory for you to drive this wedding business? Ajoy Chawla: You are right. The wedding business requires us to have more inventory, especially because it is so regional and optimizing that doesn’t become easy and the more, we go deeper, which we are already quite deep in many markets. In general, given what is required, it is turned dilutive. And we believe that we have not yet reached the optimal. Wedding hardly contributes to around Page 9 of 18 Titan Company Limited May 3, 2023 20% of our business. So, there is scope, and we are, in fact, doing it selectively in select communities and select markets. And seeing the result of that and then progressing to the next set of communities and markets. Therefore, we are phasing it and learning along the way. But definitely it requires a little bit more inventory whichever community or market we choose to go deeper in. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Tejas Shah from Spark Capital. Please go ahead. Tejas Shah: Sir, a couple of questions. Both pertain to jewellery',
    'And seeing the result of that and then progressing to the next set of communities and markets. Therefore, we are phasing it and learning along the way. But definitely it requires a little bit more inventory whichever community or market we choose to go deeper in. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Tejas Shah from Spark Capital. Please go ahead. Tejas Shah: Sir, a couple of questions. Both pertain to jewellery. First, could you please provide revenue share of wedding jewellery for fiscal ‘23? And considering the backlog of weddings that occurred during FY23, what is your outlook for the wedding calendar for FY24? Ajoy Chawla: For the year FY23, weddings have been actually a relative underperformer. It is around 19% of the total jewellery that we have sold compared to 20% last year. Actually 20% has been steady. And this is largely linked to quarter 1 of FY23 not really firing as well for wedding and we had to pivot towards other product mix. In the second half, the wedding response was better. Tejas Shah: Would we have lost market share in wedding jewellery this year? Ajoy Chawla: I am not so sure because we have gained overall market share, and therefore, internal contributions may not give you a better picture. In fact, I would believe we may have either sustained or marginally gained because in certain markets, we have seen good growth, and in those markets, we get actually decent wedding share. So, I wouldn’t say we have lost share, but I would say the scope to grow much faster is there but opportunity in FY24 certainly we have taken a much more aggressive growth target on wedding. Not just for this year but over the next 3-4 years and therefore we hope to gain further. We have, as I said, investing in select markets and select communities to dial it up even further including exchange, etc., besides inventory. Right now, we would say this year was a percentage lower in contribution',
    'So, I wouldn’t say we have lost share, but I would say the scope to grow much faster is there but opportunity in FY24 certainly we have taken a much more aggressive growth target on wedding. Not just for this year but over the next 3-4 years and therefore we hope to gain further. We have, as I said, investing in select markets and select communities to dial it up even further including exchange, etc., besides inventory. Right now, we would say this year was a percentage lower in contribution. We would like it to be a couple of percentage points higher in the coming year. Tejas Shah: And sir, how is the wedding calendar looking for FY24? Ajoy Chawla: So far, so good. Quarter 1 is certainly looking good, and H2 is always reasonably good because it has also a lot of NRI weddings, a lot of metro weddings, etc. So, so far, the calendar is looking good. And quarter 1 is always a little bit of a googly because it’s very heavily dependent on the dates specifically because a lot of rural weddings, etc., are there. Tejas Shah: And the second and last question. Sir, if you can share some insight of the profile of the new customers we are recruiting, as in which region it will be highest or in which category they normally get recruited? Is it wedding, studded, or low-end diamonds? Page 10 of 18 Ajoy Chawla: Regionally, I don’t think I can share because a lot depends on the expansion across different Titan Company Limited May 3, 2023 regions. So, newer stores also give us a lot of new customers. But typically, we tend to get new customers in the sub-50,000 price band or sub-1 lakh because gold prices have gone up. Secondly, we get a lot of new customers in gold because we are gaining share from other players and typically, they could be buying gold from there. And the studded ratio is very low for other players',

Secondly, we get a lot of new customers in gold because we are gaining share from other players and typically, they could be buying gold from there. And the studded ratio is very low for other players. Off late, we are also seeing a lot of new customer growth in the sub-50,000, both for Tanishq, for Mia, and for CaratLane because there’s an emergence of a younger audience, who is buying fine jewellery. That is more in the last maybe 1 year it’s a little more prominent. But typically, yes, it is price band and more gold if you were to ask me. Weddings – new wedding buyers are rare, though, not entirely absent, but the median is sitting in the daily wear category. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Amit Sachdeva from HSBC. Please go ahead. Amit Sachdeva: Sir, my question is for Ajoy. I see that bullion sales in this quarter were quite large, nearly 50% of the full year bullion sales, but full year bullion sales is nearly more than twice that of FY22. So, it seems like it’s a bit of a…. Is it like an assortment intensity rising or refresh rate is rising? My question is whether there is a part of old inventory being melted or excess gold being sold? And whether that jewellery margin accounts for all that value loss that may have happened if you have melted the jewellery back? And are you doing it increasingly more? Maybe the refresh rate is higher? Can you sort of describe what is the strategic intent here and how we should read it in terms of growth acceleration or inventory being refreshed and things like that? Or is there something I am digging too much into it? Ajoy Chawla: Amit, a good question. I will clarify. There are two observations which might help you follow it. This is the year when we have started importing CEPA gold',
    'I will clarify. There are two observations which might help you follow it. This is the year when we have started importing CEPA gold. There is an agreement between UAE and India and there is a 1% custom duty benefit for taking in CEPA gold. There is a quota, and you have to apply. In the current year, and most of it in the last 4-5 months, we imported a substantial quantum of CEPA gold, in several tonnes. And that gold is imported on spot basis and then there is some contango, etc. Consequently, to manage the capital employed, we have been now following a strategy of ensuring that we try to maintain GOL as a proportion of the overall inventory at a certain percentage. And because a lot of this kind of came in as a lump towards the last 4-5 months, we had to do a little bit more of bullion sale to manage the capital employed. It’s nothing to do with the previous set of doubts or thoughts you had. We also did a little bit of proactive spot buying in quarter 3 when suddenly CAD deficit, etc., was beginning to worry and we thought let’s protect ourselves from any gold-related restrictions. That also maybe added a little bit. On the broader point that you mentioned that with refresh rates changing, etc., we typically tend to look at melting and provision as two-line items and we try to relate that as a percentage to the NSV. It has been fairly stable over the last 4 or 5 years and it’s not significantly changing upward or downward. So, the melting as a percentage of the total and therefore potential value loss, etc., Page 11 of 18 is broadly consistent. Nothing much to worry about and I don’t think it’s something which is going to affect our margins for sure. Titan Company Limited May 3, 2023 Amit Sachdeva: Thanks so much, Ajoy, for clarifying this. Very helpful. I was just wondering whether there is some bigger intent here, which is not visible in general, but it might have implications. But thank you so much for that',

Very helpful. I was just wondering whether there is some bigger intent here, which is not visible in general, but it might have implications. But thank you so much for that. My second quick question, if I may ask about, which you have obviously clarified in terms of trade issue between L2, L3s and things, but is this larger intent is to sort of since you have to make the gold price competitive, it is sort of an effort to pass it along to all the channel partners and everybody mitigate costs and sort of navigate it. Or what is the genesis of it? Or it is like value capture is too high since the gold price is high that it needs to be balanced out. In that case, are you investing the gains back into the business for growth? Or what is the real intent here? Just wanted to understand. Ajoy Chawla: Again, two comments. One is that we invested ahead in terms of both the gold rate and inventory even before we made these changes. So, our investments over the last couple of years have been high and will continue to be high. We are all investing for growth, even not trying to recover. The second piece is, we are actually trying to moderate the product mix in a different way to manage the gross margins. Because, let’s say, if you are losing out on gold rate, the best way to gain is by being able to give a richer mix or a more higher complexity mix, etc., and do some product engineering. If we have to do that, then we have to ensure that both of us as well as the partners are aligned in the same direction. There is no point in me supplying it if that doesn’t sell',

If we have to do that, then we have to ensure that both of us as well as the partners are aligned in the same direction. There is no point in me supplying it if that doesn’t sell. If the incentives are better or the margins are better on higher complexity or medium complexity products, then we are aligned in the same direction. That will give a better margin to us and a better margin to them as well. And therefore, this entire exercise was aligning us and them in the same direction going forward, and we are seeing a lot of work going on in the product mix. And as I said, it was a 15-year-old TOT. At that time, we didn’t have many of the products at all that we are today selling. So, actually, there is nothing about trying to share and capture value. It is purely about aligning towards a more profitable future. Amit Sachdeva: Just very quickly, Ajoy, if I may ask about the international expansion piece and it seems that domestic is 21%, but overall is 23%, which means International is already adding 2 percentage roughly growth rate to the overall mix. It seems to me that International is going pretty well. And can you share the number of stores you plan to open this year and whether L2 or L3 format is gaining momentum there as well or is largely L2 and your own store? Can you give us some color on international piece, the ambition for this year? Kuruvilla Markose: This is Diny here. You are right that International is going pretty well. Wherever we have been able to open stores, the response has been quite overwhelming and very very positive. We are up to 7 stores now, six in the UAE and one open in the US since December',
    'You are right that International is going pretty well. Wherever we have been able to open stores, the response has been quite overwhelming and very very positive. We are up to 7 stores now, six in the UAE and one open in the US since December. And in the coming year, we are looking to add quite a few more. We are planning to expand to roughly around 25 stores cumulative by the end of FY24. Large number of them across the GCC region, in UAE as Page 12 of 18 well as other countries around Qatar, Bahrain, Oman are all possibilities. And also, expanding our footprint across the US. That is the plan. Titan Company Limited May 3, 2023 Amit Sachdeva: Is L2 or L3? Which is the format you are essentially using? Or is it your own capital? Kuruvilla Markose: We have all 3 formats. We started out with L1 in the UAE, essentially for us to sort of get our hands dirty and understand how the business works because we are doing this for the first time in an international geography. But we also have L2 in the US and now we are opening some L3 as partners are gaining greater confidence. Like Venkat said earlier on the call, a lot of our partners or franchisees in India are asking for a chance to be given to them to operate a store in international markets. We are also now finding a lot of local partners, meaning people who were not in any way connected with Tanishq or Titan earlier, who are also coming forward on the strength of what they have seen. We recently announced a tie-up with Sharaf Group who runs the Sharaf DG chain of stores in the UAE. They have come forward as a partner to work with us as franchisees for stores that will be Tanishq branded. They will be like any other partner operating a store for us. Amit Sachdeva: And I am sure the qualitative strategy will emerge eventually for non-Indian population as well',

Amit Sachdeva: And I am sure the qualitative strategy will emerge eventually for non-Indian population as well. But is there a plan towards that end as well that when you go to the US market, there is a large, very different kind of mix as well that exists, very high margin? Are you still an Indian diaspora and that’s what the reason of being there as well? Is the customer mix and product mix going to be very different or is very different already? Kuruvilla Markose: At this point, it is almost 98% Indian. We get a lot of South Asians in our stores in GCC, but predominantly Indian. And that’s the beachhead that we are attempting to establish. But like you said, obviously, the market in many of these geographies for the non-Indian consumer is much larger, much bigger, and hopefully much more profitable, and therefore we would certainly want to go after that. But at this point in time, the primary focus and objective is to develop a very very strong competitive and high-quality offerings for Indian consumers; give them a really superlative experience. But just to give you an indication in the Titan Eye+ format that we have launched in Dubai, we are getting up to 25-30% non-Indian customers. That’s because we are present in a mall location and certainly the products that we have to offer and the strength of value offering from India seems to be working very very well. Early indications are very very positive. C. K. Venkataraman: Amit, Venkat here. The other opportunity is that all the Indians that we are currently acquiring as customers also have a pretty decent non-Indian jewellery that they buy, not just the Indian jewellery that they buy to wear with Indian clothes, Indian occasions and all that',
    'Early indications are very very positive. C. K. Venkataraman: Amit, Venkat here. The other opportunity is that all the Indians that we are currently acquiring as customers also have a pretty decent non-Indian jewellery that they buy, not just the Indian jewellery that they buy to wear with Indian clothes, Indian occasions and all that. For example, brands like Signet and Kay’s and Jared’s and why not even Tiffany and brands like that. We want to become a one-stop shop for all Indians, apart from the point that Diny made about non- Indians but even among Indians. With the product lines that we are currently going with from Tanishq, Mia, and Zoya and all that satisfy substantially the needs of the Indian consumers. But Page 13 of 18 Titan Company Limited May 3, 2023 the non-Indian needs of the Indian consumers is also a pretty decent opportunity. And Diny and team are working to understand that better, create product lines to cater to those needs and therefore maximize the share of wallet and the total share of jewellery purchase as well. And one last point. Many people have spoken, asked questions relating to the terms of trade change. And I would just request all of you to sort of step back on and see the subject as which Ajoy has said, but I am just saying it again to reinforce it. It’s an operating aspect of the business. And frankly, the questions are sort of ending up making it look like a strategic or a business model kind of subject which it is not. It is an operating aspect. As long as we continue to deliver best-in-class returns to our partners, which even after this we are delivering, I would wager that in the Indian retail industry, Tanishq would deliver best-in-class even after this. So, therefore, it is just an operating matter and does not merit the kind of level of conversation perhaps it is going into. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Latika Chopra from J. P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Latika Chopra: I had a question on Mia',

So, therefore, it is just an operating matter and does not merit the kind of level of conversation perhaps it is going into. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Latika Chopra from J. P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Latika Chopra: I had a question on Mia. I wanted to understand, what is the revenue size for this brand for FY23? And what is the split coming from the standalone stores? There are about 111 stores now. And how are you think about the store addition plans here? Ajoy Chawla: Mia has done exceptionally well. It has gone up almost 3x in the year. Just to give you a sense, in consumer price terms, it is about Rs. 730-740 crores this year, growing rapidly. And we expect Mia to hit Rs. 1,300-1,350 crores in the coming year. About 40% of the business is coming from Mia standalone stores. The rest of it is coming from Tanishq stores because it’s a sub-brand of Tanishq, and right now very negligible is coming from online. So, the opportunity and headroom online are huge because the ticket sizes are bang on. In terms of the 110 stores or whatever that you talked about; we expect to double that by the end of this fiscal. We are going aggressively on expansion. The opportunity is huge. And this is still within the top 30-40 towns, not really going too deep: in fact, most of it is in the top 25 towns. We see a large opportunity for Mia and fine jewellery is kind of coming of age. CaratLane has also seen that, Mia has also seen, and this is the emergence of a segment, which is very exciting. Latika Chopra: I just wanted to also check for CaratLane',

Latika Chopra: I just wanted to also check for CaratLane. Is there a timeline or a thought process or even if there is something that you would want to acquire the rest of the stake in the company? Is this something that could happen in the immediate future, or you are pretty happy with the arrangement or ownership that you have currently? Ashok Sonthalia: Latika, you are well aware, you have asked I think earlier also, that this matter cannot be commented upon till we become obliged to inform with the stock exchange and which we will do. Right now, we would not like to comment on this kind of question. Page 14 of 18 Titan Company Limited May 3, 2023 Latika Chopra: The last bit I had was on watches business. I think, if I heard it correctly, you mentioned 12-13% target margins for this segment. Could you share what has been this revenue salience of wearables in FY23 revenue mix? And what kind of margins does this operate at? And is this a reason that probably margins for this segment could be in this band? Suparna Mitra: Latika, in quarter 4, we were about 13%, but for the overall year, we were about 10% of the total turnover. And the margins in this are slightly lower than watches. It is also reflective of the 3 decades of leadership that we have in watches that we are able to command that kind of premium. Having said that, in wearables, we are at a premium to similar comparable products from other brands and doing well. Over a period of time with various other business decisions including Make in India, the margins will only improve',

Over a period of time with various other business decisions including Make in India, the margins will only improve. But yes, long-term, wearables present a huge business opportunity where inherently the margins are of a lower profile than watches. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Chirag Shah from CLSA. Please go ahead. Chirag Shah: Ajoy, I just wanted your thoughts. In a phase of rising interest rate environment and higher gold prices, I was wondering how this interplay impacts our business, 1) from a perspective of the spread in borrowing cost between gold leasing and informal sector borrowing cost. Fair to assume that this spread would have widened because the working capital cost increases for the informal sector should outpace the increasing gold leasing rates. 2) And then how does this impact franchise economics. This is of course beyond the franchise sharing agreements that you kind of alluded to. Ajoy Chawla: You are right that informal or unorganized sector will find it more difficult with rising interest costs; as it is, bank borrowing is not easy for them. The jewellery sector is not very favored by banks. So, higher interest costs and tougher financial conditions will impact. From a customer point of view, in the sense, once gold rates stabilize, customers are actually comfortable coming in. But yes, in terms of maintaining a certain quantum of gold, let’s say kgs of gold, it does impact. Having said that, the informal sector also does not in a way… they have gold, which is historically there, not on debt, and they typically view that as wealth. And their quantum of gold holding is also quite significant compared to us',

And their quantum of gold holding is also quite significant compared to us. In terms of stock turns, we are much better than most. They don’t look at stock turns. I don’t know, maybe if it sustains for a long enough time, it does create pressure. And certainly, those who are weak tend to become weaker and many of the independents who are strong become stronger. And we have seen that happen over the last few years. I’m not sure if I answered all parts of your question. Is there something else…. Chirag Shah: On franchisee economics, how does the rising interest rate environment impact them? Ajoy Chawla: For L3s, it can affect because L3s are on buy and sell and therefore there is an impact on them. But the margins and the turns of L3 are very high and their returns on investments are pretty strong. And many of our L3s are also quite older in the system and they are getting fabulous returns. Their scale economics are very high. For the newer L3s who might have come in the Page 15 of 18 Titan Company Limited May 3, 2023 system, yes, there is impact, but there, in fact, our new structure is enabling them even better. So, as I was telling, some franchisees may have lost but many have gained. Many of the smaller, newer, and lower-scale franchisees are actually going to gain in some of our changes that we have made about – structural changes. So, no, it’s not a big concern for us if that’s what is bothering you. Chirag Shah: And can you just give us a sense on the trend of Golden Harvest registration? And secondly, on the studded jewellery side, of course, this was an activation quarter',

And secondly, on the studded jewellery side, of course, this was an activation quarter. We have also mentioned that the lower-cost inventory of diamonds is kind of behind us. Can you just explain how does the inventory buying cycle really work on the diamond side? Ajoy Chawla: On Golden Harvest, we have had fabulous enrollments. Quarter 2, quarter 3, Quarter 4 are very very healthy double-digit enrollments. And we have a metric called enrollment to buyer ratio, which is driven across different stores, and we are seeing fabulous percentages at their all-time highs. That is very good from a lead metric for future intent to buy jewellery at least from us. So, we are very happy with Golden Harvest and it’s actually firing very well for us. Regarding diamond studded, yes, the activation quarter was good. Therefore, we had a better mix than last year, but it was still slightly below if I go pre-pandemic year. That year again, last 15 days, there was a lockdown and gold got affected, so I’m not able to comment. But yes, we have come close to what we used to be pre-pandemic in terms of studded ratio. We expect to drive faster growth in studded. I mean, that’s always been the intent, but this is an…. we have delinked the two. In the sense, we no longer worry too much about the ratio as much as each segment growing at a certain pace. I didn’t follow the question on the inventory cycle, but typically studded inventory turns are lower than the gold ones, pretty much because that’s historically the case. Chirag Shah: My question was more from the perspective of…',

I didn’t follow the question on the inventory cycle, but typically studded inventory turns are lower than the gold ones, pretty much because that’s historically the case. Chirag Shah: My question was more from the perspective of…. On the slide, you have mentioned that the consumption of older, lower cost diamond inventory got over in Q3, and we are now getting into the newer inventory buying cycle. How does the diamond inventory buying cycle work? Ajoy Chawla: We had some gains on account of buying…. We had an opening stock of diamonds at a certain price. And then because it had gone up, we had increased the selling prices, which was ahead of the cost hitting us. Now the consumption of all those low-cost diamonds is over and done, and therefore there’s a normalization of the studded margins. So, the diamond inventory gains are no longer there. How does it work? We typically work on some consumption cycles, and we have to predict 3 to 4 months ahead of time to buy diamonds. And it’s one of the most challenging questions you have asked. Even I am trying to figure out whether we can do it better. Chirag Shah: What exactly do you mean by digitally influenced sales which is now at about 18%? Page 16 of 18 Titan Company Limited May 3, 2023 Ajoy Chawla: Digitally influenced…. In CaratLane? You are referring to which particular segment? Chirag Shah: On one of the few slides earlier, I think on slide #9, you have mentioned digitally influenced sales in Q4 was close to about 18%. Ajoy Chawla: When we look at digitally influenced sales, actually there is online; people who come online and buy online. Then there are people who come online, engage in a conversation with our live agents, etc., and thereafter, we do an omni, i.e',

Then there are people who come online, engage in a conversation with our live agents, etc., and thereafter, we do an omni, i.e., we hand them over to the store guys. And then there is a third element, we also do a lot of endless aisle, video call-based selling, etc. That also, we are in a way…. The customer who may have walked in in some store might see products lying in some other store. All of that, we also look at in terms of digitally influenced. And there are some other indirect attributions that we also look at in terms of people who were reached out on social media and digital, and then how many of them actually came in and bought. That is some data that also comes to us from our partners. And I think a lot of that 18% that you are seeing number there, it is about joint closure of omni and online. And I think that 18% is a weighted average of between CaratLane, Tanishq, Mia, all put together. Chirag Shah: If I may just squeeze in one more to Saumen, what is the revised store rollout target for the Eyewear business now? And can you dwell a bit more on the distribution model expansion going forward, please? Saumen Bhaumik: Chirag, we will open another 100 stores in the coming 8 to 10 months, hopefully in the first 6 months. But we are not going beyond the top 20 or 21 cities. That’s the change that we have made. Therefore, around the first half of FY24 or around that period in October-November, I think we should be around the number that we spoke about 1-1/2 years back. On the distribution front, I think we have taken some aggressive goals here. I think we have altered our product portfolio',

On the distribution front, I think we have taken some aggressive goals here. I think we have altered our product portfolio. We have also re-engineered the terms of trade for our dealer fraternity. With this, we believe that we will be able to reach out to a lot more outlets across the length and breadth of the country. And therefore, we should be able to cater to a lot more customers. In the areas, in the district, in the towns where let’s say a retail store by itself may not be the most viable proposition. Chirag Shah: You explained the margin part for this quarter. But if I can just get in a bit more there, you mentioned that the sunglasses growth this quarter it was about 61% versus lenses at about 20%. So, has the product mix also impacted margins? And do you think the competitive intensity last quarter was much higher with your key competitor getting more aggressive? Saumen Bhaumik: I think competition wouldn’t have affected our overall number, both the top-line and the final thing. I think some of the things that I explained on the top-line side, one channel did not really make any contribution towards the last month. And we also had to make certain corrections in order to prepare ourselves for FY24. On the cost front, there are a few one-time things that have Page 17 of 18 hit us. So, I would broadly place the quarter 4 results in that space rather than saying that external factors impacted our numbers. Titan Company Limited May 3, 2023 Moderator: Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. I now hand the conference over to Mr. C. K. Venkataraman for closing comments.
